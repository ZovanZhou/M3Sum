Hello, Gong Hei Fat Choy, and I don't know how to say it in Mandarin, but Sir Paul will

00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:19,480
What's going on?

4
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:26,320
We are at Main Street, no not Main Street, we're at Chinatown in Vancouver, British Columbia,

5
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:28,320
and we're coming here for the Chinese...

6
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:29,320
It's Chinatown.

7
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:33,600
Chinatown, and we're here for the Chinese New Year parade.

8
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:34,600

It's Sunday.

12
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:39,480
There's lots of hot jandis going all around.

13
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:40,480
I'm loving it.

14
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:41,480
Oh yeah, baby.

15
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:44,480
And Sir Paul, I don't know where he went, but...

16
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:45,480
He went to the pastry shop.

17
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:46,480

18
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:47,480
He's going to the pastry shop.

00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:48,480
Woo!

20
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:49,480
Whoa!

21
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:50,480
Ah!

22
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:51,480
I just realized it's you!

23
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:53,640
I just realized it's you!

24
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:00,640
Close your eyes.

25
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:15,640
So in Disney, the dreams that you first want come true.

26
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:16,800
Thank you.

27
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:25,800
Security!

28
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:38,800
There you go.

29
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:39,800
Smile!

30
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,800
That's a little smile.

31
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:43,800
Thank you.

32
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:44,960

The Disney Strip!

35
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,120
Rooks, Gong Hei Fat Choy.

36
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:09,120
Rooks, sorry pal, Gong Hei Fat Choy.

37
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:14,120
I think there's dragons going that way.

38
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,120
I think there's dragons going that way.

39
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,120
Oh, look at that.

40
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,120
Oh, slow down there.

41
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,120
Ouch!

Hello.

47
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,280
You're fired.

Thank you.

63
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,120
That's where I was sitting.

64
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,120
I was sitting right above a needle.

65
00:07:53,120 --> 00:08:13,120
Thank you.

66
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:15,120
We are at the Dr. What's his name?

67
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,120

70
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,120
And we just saw the parade.

71
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:25,120
It was fucking wicked.

72
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,120
Lots of hot jaundice.

73
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:30,120
I'm chilling here with Sir Paul.

74
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:33,120
Professor Bestestie is holding the camera.

75
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,120
Yo, yo, I'm on the camera.

76
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:36,120
And yeah, basically we're having a good time.

77
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:38,120
Big lake here.

78
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:40,120
Lots of fine honeys.

79
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:46,120
And great architecture from one of the best countries in the world.

80
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:48,120
One of the oldest civilizations.

81
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,120
China.

82
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:55,120
And we're just going to have a look around and see all the cool shite that they have up in this small pub.
