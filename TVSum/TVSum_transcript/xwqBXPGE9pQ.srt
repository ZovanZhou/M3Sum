00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
We're taking smartphone, spaceship technology on a motorcycle platform with the safety of a car.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Basically it's a robot motorcycle. It self-balances and really increases your safety and your range and the excitement of riding a motorcycle.

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:27,000
200 miles per charge, it's a two-wheel drive, wheel hub motor, electric vehicle.

4
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:42,000
You steer it like a car, you sit in it like a car, you have pedals like a car, but the robot side, it takes your steering input and leans you into turns a lot like a jet fighter.

5
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
So as you can see, full electronics in here.

6
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:53,000
And this is actually our real gyro right here, if you want to take a look at this.

7
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:59,000
The gyroscope's inside basically output around 1,300 foot-pounds of torque.

8
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
So you basically need a baby elephant to knock it over.

9
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
It's a lot like a CMG or a control moment gyro.

10
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:14,000
The International Space Station and most satellites use the same orientation technology.

11
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
We've just kind of taken that and made it commercially available.

12
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:27,000
There are servos and there are gyro motors, there are traction motors, but sensors like an IMU, IR sensors.

13
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:36,000
There's actually a lot of temperature and heat sensors, a myriad of sensors that actually all feed data that has to be processed.

14
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:51,000
And through that process, a command to the gyros to tilt and lean the vehicle to keep it balanced or either to lean into a turn, it's very dependently based on our processing system.

15
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
The prototype that we have now uses two i7s.

16
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,000
At our end product, we should be using something that would power a smartphone today.

17
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,000
One of the hurdles in our development is having the vehicle actually be more aware of its surroundings.

18
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:16,000
So it's kind of like putting AI but also having good sensory perception of the road, of any kind of external influences or disturbances,

19
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:23,000
and having that all get computed and processed to allow for stability in all scenarios.

20
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:30,000
On the heads-up display, you can see battery life, range, how much left you have in your procession budget.

21
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
It's kind of like your artificial horizon.

22
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:41,000
And also, it's basically a rolling smartphone, so all of the information on your smartphone will be on a side panel.

23
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Upgrading the hardware, the gyro can be done pretty easily.

24
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
The gyros actually come and the battery pack come in its own modular unit.

25
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:56,000
So you can upgrade the gyro output, you can upgrade the battery size, or both.

26
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:04,000
So if you want a faster, more robust, more stabilized C1, it's pretty easy to upgrade that.

27
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:11,000
The chassis is made out of steel. We could be using some kind of composite body for the interior as well.

28
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Parts count, we're one-tenth of a part of a car.

29
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Cars typically have around 24,000 parts.

30
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:25,000
If you drive an Audi, it's 40,000. We only have 2,239.

31
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:30,000
So it's pretty easy to manufacture, that's why we can make it affordable.

32
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:36,000
In our audience, urban professionals, tech junkies, they have to have the first thing.

33
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:55,000
They commute, they have a professional life, they still want to have fun, but at an affordable price.
