00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.400
Give it up for her.

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:21.520
Ah.

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:28.520
I'll keep it short and sweet.

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:49.520
I want to talk to you just real quick about what we tell our players.

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:55.520
I think it will help everybody here on the show.

00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:00.520
Now obviously we all go through adverse situations.

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:04.520
Be it something major that happens to your family or to you or something minor.

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:07.520
Find out a friend's lying to you or something like that.

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:11.520
We all deal with it differently.

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:18.520
But we say to some of our players, we ask them consistently to play their next play.

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:22.520
Don't get caught up in the play that just happened.

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:25.520
Play the next play.

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:28.520
And if you think about the quiet edge of your life,

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:32.520
don't get caught up in the things that are behind you or the things that are in front of you.

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.520
Just go play the next play.

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:38.520
And I think it will really help you with the things that you are attempting to do.

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.520
Be it sports, school, whatever it is.

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.520
I've got a quick little analogy for you.

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:49.520
I don't know if you've heard this. I don't want to bust it out.

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:51.520
There's a little folklore.

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:58.520
This is relatively true because I just made it up.

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:09.520
There's a tribe that survives on catching monkeys out in the forest.

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:11.520
It happens.

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:15.520
These monkeys love coconuts.

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:18.520
They love the insides of coconuts.

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:23.520
Stay with me here now.

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:27.520
What these tribes would do is tie a rope to a coconut.

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:30.520
And they would cut a hole just big enough for the end of that coconut

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:36.520
so that the monkey can take their hand, stick it inside the coconut,

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:42.520
and grab the sweet insides.

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:44.520
The only problem is this though.

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:49.520
When the monkey would go to pull their hand out, it couldn't get out.

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:54.520
So the tribesmen would come along, pull the rope in, along with the monkey,

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:57.520
and there they're done.

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:01.520
Here's the moral of the story. I want you to remember this.

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:04.520
All that monkey had to do was what?

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:08.520
Let go.

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:11.520
All he had to do was let go.

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:15.520
So tonight at the game, when you're watching, when our players are playing,

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:19.520
let's not get caught up in the great things or the little things

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:21.520
or the bad things that happen along the way.

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:23.520
Let's keep marching forward.

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:26.520
Keep playing. Keep hammering. Keep getting after it.

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:29.520
And you do that tonight, you do that at school next week,

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:32.520
you do that for the rest of your life, and good things will come your way.

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:34.520
I guarantee it.

00:03:34.520 --> 00:04:02.520
Thank you.

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:25.520
Let's go.

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:37.520
Take some of that.

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:43.520
Take some of that.

00:04:43.520 --> 00:05:11.520
Take some of that.

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:38.520
Take some of that.

00:05:38.520 --> 00:06:06.520
Let's go.

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:16.520
Let's go.

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:50.520
Let's go.

00:06:50.520 --> 00:07:14.520
Let's go.

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:26.520
Let's give it up again for the faculty.
