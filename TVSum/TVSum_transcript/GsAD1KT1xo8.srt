00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:27,520
You gotta set to the goals

4
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:29,520
If you're searching for a way out

5
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:31,520
You gotta take a new road

6
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:33,520
If you don't keep the motion moving

7
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:35,520
You cannot feel the same

8
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,520
In the heart of the city

9
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:39,520
Where the streets are the veins

10
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:41,520
Oh, when I'm riding low

11
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,520
Oh, when the river's dry

12
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,520
Oh, can you help me go on

13
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,520
One more time

14
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,520
We're gonna get up for this

15
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,520
We're not gonna stop

16
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,520
We're gonna get up for this

17
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,520
We're gonna get up for this

18
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:57,520
We're never gonna run and hide

19
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:03,520
If I get down and say that I wanna change my mind

20
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,520
Put me in a circle

21
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:07,520
So I can change it one more time

22
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:09,520
Put me in a circle

23
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:11,520
Put me in a circle

24
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:31,520
Circle, circle, circle

25
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:33,520
One more time

26
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:35,520
We're gonna get up for this

27
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:39,520
We're never gonna run and hide

28
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:43,520
If I get down and say that I wanna change my mind

29
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,520
Put me in a circle

30
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,520
So I can change it one more time

31
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,520
Put me in a circle

32
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,520
Put me in a circle

33
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,520
Put me in a circle

34
00:01:53,520 --> 00:02:13,520
Circle, circle, circle

35
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,520
I don't know where I'm going

36
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,520
But I know where I've been

37
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,520
And it's never in the knowing

38
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,520
It's in the not giving in

39
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,520
And when the earth is slipping, tripping
