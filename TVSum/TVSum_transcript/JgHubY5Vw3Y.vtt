Okay, so you finally invested in a bike and now you need to know how to keep it

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:07.680
safe and we're gonna show you how.

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:29.600
I'm here with Zach from Purefix. Can you give us some expert tips for keeping our

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:34.520
ride safe, Zach? I can, thanks Amanda. A bike is an important investment and you

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:38.640
want to keep it safe. The first thing I recommend is getting rid of any quick

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.000
release levers on your bike.

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.680
Quick release levers on your wheels and seatposts make removing them easy and

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.520
that makes stealing them easy. It only takes a few seconds to remove a quick

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.960
release front wheel or saddle. You should replace any quick release levers with

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:58.160
Allen bolts or 15 millimeter nuts. This doesn't mean your wheels and saddles are

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:02.840
safe, it just makes them harder for a passerby to jack them.

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.560
If you have a daily commuter that's locked up outside a lot, you might want

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:15.240
to consider some camo for your ride. A bike that looks fresh and clean attracts

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.120
would-be thieves. Try adding some creative touches to your frame. You can

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:22.480
use stickers of your favorite brands to cover up logos. That'll make it look

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:26.320
used even though it may be brand new. Your bike won't ride any different but

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:29.680
it'll be much less attractive to thieves.

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:36.000
Don't ever leave your bike unlocked. Now to lock your bike using a u-lock, it's

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.880
the best to attach the lock through your rear wheel around part of the frame. Make

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:44.760
sure to lock it to a solid object that can't be broken or moved and make sure

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:48.340
to lock it to your frame. Some people forget that. If you're using a chain lock

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:53.160
too, loop this through the front wheel and around part of the frame. No lock is

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:57.800
ever a hundred percent safe. If someone has enough time and determination, they

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:01.920
can cut through just about anything. But if you follow these tips, you can reduce

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.680
your chances of being another statistic. Alright, thank you so much Zach. You guys

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:10.360
got to remember to get the right lock and lock up your bike. If you have any

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:14.600

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:25.360
see you in the streets.
