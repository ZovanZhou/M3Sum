1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,160
Hey Miffy, do you know what this is?

2
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:09,160
Do you want some cat food?

3
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:11,160
No?

4
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:14,800
What else do we have?

5
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:16,800
We got some other kind of food.

6
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,480
We got some dog food.

7
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:19,480
Can cats eat dog food?

8
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:21,640
Do you think she'll eat dog food?

9
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:22,640
You say, what do you say?

10
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:23,640
Yes or no?

11
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:24,640
Yes!

12
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:25,640
Yes.

13
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:26,640
You think she'll eat dog food?

14
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:27,640
Yes.

15
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:28,640
Yes?

16
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:29,640
Alright.

17
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:30,640
Look at this Miff.

18
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:31,640
You want to eat this dog food?

19
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:32,640
Huh?

20
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:33,640
What is this?

21
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:34,640
Does it look good to you?

22
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:35,640
I don't believe it.

23
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:36,640
She's eating it.

24
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:37,640
I don't believe it.

25
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:38,640
She's eating it.

26
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:39,640
Hey you eat that dog food.

27
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:40,640
That's good stuff.

28
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:41,640
You want to eat this?

29
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:42,640
No.

30
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:43,640
No?

31
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:44,640
No?

32
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:45,640
No?

33
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:46,640
No?

34
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:47,640
No?

35
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:48,640
No?

36
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:49,640
No?

37
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:50,640
No?

38
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:51,640
No?

39
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:52,640
No?

40
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:53,640
No?

41
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:54,640
No?

42
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:55,640
No?

43
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:56,640
No?

44
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:57,640
No?

45
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:58,640
No?

46
00:00:58,640 --> 00:00:59,640
No?

47
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:00,640
No?

48
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:01,640
No?

49
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:02,640
You can't eat it.

50
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:03,640
Ah, it's moving around too much on her so I'm going to get a plate for her.

51
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:12,040
I just need to try and see if their cat loves it because I don't believe that Miffy actually

52
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:13,040
loves it.

53
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:19,040
We should put on the label pet food for dog and cat.

54
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:22,120
For dogs and cats.

55
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:40,920
Miffy really likes that stuff.

56
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:41,920
Mmm mmm.

57
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:42,920
She ate that big part.

58
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:45,280
Oh yeah, that's good.

59
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:49,720
Just to let you guys know that are watching this, our cat is really picky.

60
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:52,480
There's a lot of cat food that she won't eat.

61
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:55,120
This is kind of strange to see her eating dog food.

62
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:58,760
But she really likes this dog food so I might have to buy this again.

63
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:02,720
If she doesn't get sick off of it, I'll buy it again.

64
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:05,720
It's a, oh, Miffy.

65
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:08,720
Alright, it's good stuff.

66
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:15,720
I like it when she shakes her head, it's fun.

67
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:16,720
Feels good.

68
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:20,720
It's the Miffy Show.

69
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:21,720
Now she's looking at me.

70
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:25,720
Miff, Miff, Miff it up.

71
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:30,720
Hey, this is Miffy's show.

72
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,720
We just fed our cat dog food.

73
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,720
That's kind of funny.

74
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,720
Yeah, she really liked it.

75
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:37,720
She did.

76
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:39,720
I knew it.

77
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:41,720
That was fun, wasn't it?

78
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:43,720
Yeah, that was fun.

79
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:46,720
Yeah, I was talking to her though, it was fun to eat the dog food.

80
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:47,720
It was fun for us too.

81
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:49,720
Yeah, it sure is.

82
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:52,720
I don't believe a cat can eat dog food.

83
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,720
Busted.

84
00:02:54,720 --> 00:03:01,720
Bust, busted.

85
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:03,720
Well, Miffy survived the night.

86
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:07,720
She ate dog food and didn't get sick, did you Miff?

87
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:09,720
You're pretty healthy, you feel good?

88
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:13,720
Taking some good naps today?

89
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:15,720
You didn't get sick, did you?

90
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:16,720
Huh?

91
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,720
You all right?

92
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,720
Still got your fat belly?

93
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:23,720
You can see that she really liked her dog food.

94
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:26,720
She ate most of it, made a little bit of a mess.

95
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,720
But that's pretty good.

96
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:41,720
She ate more of the dog food than she eats of a lot of cat food brands.

97
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:44,720
So yes, cats can eat dog food.

98
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:59,720
Yay!
