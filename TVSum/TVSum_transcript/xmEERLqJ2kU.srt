1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Hold fast.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Instructing.

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:41,000
handle another go around, so we're going to let Gary go this week.

4
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I'll keep it short and sweet.

5
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I want to talk to you just real quick about what we tell our players, and I think it will

6
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
help everybody here on the show.

7
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Now obviously, we all go through adversity.

8
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
We go through adverse situations.

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Be it something major that happens to your family or to you or something minor, find

10
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
out a friend's lying to you or something like that.

11
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
We all deal with it differently.

12
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
But we say to some of our players, and it's called, we ask them consistently to play the

13
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
next play.

14
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Don't get caught up in the play that just happened.

15
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Play the next play.

16
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
And if you think about the quiet edge of your life, don't get caught up in the things that

17
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,000
are behind you or the things that are going to just go play the next play.

18
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
And I think it will really help you with the things that you are attempting to do, be it

19
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
sports, school, whatever it is.

20
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I've got a quick little analogy for you.

21
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
The players have heard this.

22
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I'm going to bust it out.

23
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:55,000
There's a little folklore, and this is relatively true because I just made that up.

24
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
But I'm going to bust it out.

25
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:10,000
There's a tribe that survives on catching monkeys out in the forest.

26
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,000
These monkeys love coconuts.

27
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
They love the insides of coconuts.

28
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Stay with me here now.

29
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:28,000
What these tribes would do is tie a rope to a coconut, and they would cut a hole just

30
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,000
big enough at the end of that coconut so that the monkey could take their hand, stick it

31
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:42,000
inside the coconut, and then grab the sweet insides.

32
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
The problem is this, though.

33
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:49,000
When the monkey would go to pull their hand out, it couldn't get it out.

34
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:55,000
So the tribes would come along, pull the rope in along with the monkey, and now they're

35
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
done.

36
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Here's the moral of the story, and I want you to remember this.

37
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
All that monkey had to do was what?

38
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Let go.

39
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
All it had to do was let go.

40
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:16,000
So tonight at the game, when you're watching, when our players are playing, let's not get

41
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
caught up in the great things or the little things or the bad things that happen along

42
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
the way.

43
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Let's keep marching forward.

44
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Keep playing.

45
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Keep hammering.

46
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Keep getting after it.

47
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000
And you do that tonight, you do that at school next week, you do that for the rest of your

48
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
life, and good things will come your way.

49
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I guarantee it.

50
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Thank you.

51
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Thank you.

52
00:04:33,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Thank you.

53
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Thank you.

54
00:05:33,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Thank you.

55
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Thank you.

56
00:06:33,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Thank you.

57
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Thank you.
