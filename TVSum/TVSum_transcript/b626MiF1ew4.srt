1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:18,400
I like really hit the gym, like really thorough that night.

2
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:19,680
We call ourselves Charlotte Parkour.

3
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:24,520
We're basically, we are the, we started training parkour about, the first of us started about

4
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:31,000
70 years ago here at UNC Charlotte and since then we've grown into a bigger group.

5
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,360
Other people have started to join us, we've progressed, a lot of us have learned, met

6
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:38,120
other people.

7
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:42,200
Parkour is a discipline of training your mind and body to overcome obstacles.

8
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:47,480
We train this by running, jumping, climbing, vaulting, balancing, things like that.

9
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:52,240
If you want to try a new jump, you're not just, you don't just physically jump, at the

10
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:57,560
same time you have to overcome the mental fear and like the, overcoming the obstacle

11
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:58,560
process.

12
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:03,360
So, it's a process of breaking down obstacles like in your head and figuring out the different

13
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:08,120
parts and training those parts, bringing it back together and then it's also a process

14
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:09,720
of facing the fear.

15
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:14,600
So, you might be physically capable of doing a new jump or some new move, but at the same

16
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:20,040
time there's a fear like telling you like, oh you're going to get hurt and you have to

17
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:23,680
suppress that fear, like learn to control it and at the same time listen to it, you

18
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:29,920
know, know when it's right and when you know better.

19
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:35,360
We teach now, we teach classes here, we teach seminars, hoping to share what we know with

20
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:36,360
other people.

21
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:40,240
Really, everyone's kind of been standing around, I just want everyone really to kind of do

22
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:44,480
like this on each leg, this is going to just kind of get our ankles warmed up a little

23
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:49,600
bit.

24
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:53,760
While we're doing this, let's go ahead and warm up our wrists some.

25
00:01:53,760 --> 00:02:08,160
So, just kind of roll your wrists like this.

26
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,760
Rolls are something that can save your life or your knee.

27
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:14,780
I tore two muscles in my knee because I fell off a building and I didn't roll.

28
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:18,840
My leg buckled to the side, but had I actually rolled, I would have been okay.

29
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:22,440
Core decision, so this is something that will definitely come in handy and if you've ever

30
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:25,920
seen people do the dive rolls, that's what I'm going to be teaching you too.

31
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:29,600
So we'll start with rolls on the ground, fall rolls and then dive rolls.

32
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:40,840
Push off and really drive your shoulder, everything into the ground.

33
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:46,480
The way that I learned best to do this is that you swing with your foot through, that'll

34
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:50,000
provide your body with the motion up you need and your hands are just there to support you

35
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,360
when you come back down.

36
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:57,280
So it's a little bit weird, but basically watch how I'm using my right foot on the jump,

37
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:01,360
that'll pick me up, my hands are only there to support me on the way back down.

38
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:17,600
So coming through, I'll just go here.

39
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:37,600
How many people have you tried before?

40
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,600
Smile about it.

41
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:39,600
You ready to let go?

42
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:40,600
Yeah!

43
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:41,600
Scoot on over.

44
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:42,600
Is that for me?

45
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:43,600
Please do.

46
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:44,600
There was some episode of Avatar, this guy's teasing a prison guard.

47
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:45,600
Okay, who's pinching who's nipple?

48
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:55,600
Whom?
