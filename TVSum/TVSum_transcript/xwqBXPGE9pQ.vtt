00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000
We're taking smartphone, spaceship technology on a motorcycle platform with the safety of a car.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Basically it's a robot motorcycle. It self-balances and really increases your safety and your range and the excitement of riding a motorcycle.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:27.000
200 miles per charge, it's a two-wheel drive, wheel hub motor, electric vehicle.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:42.000
You steer it like a car, you sit in it like a car, you have pedals like a car, but the robot side, it takes your steering input and leans you into turns a lot like a jet fighter.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000
So as you can see, full electronics in here.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:53.000
And this is actually our real gyro right here, if you want to take a look at this.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:59.000
The gyroscope's inside basically output around 1,300 foot-pounds of torque.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
So you basically need a baby elephant to knock it over.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
It's a lot like a CMG or a control moment gyro.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:14.000
The International Space Station and most satellites use the same orientation technology.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000
We've just kind of taken that and made it commercially available.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:27.000
There are servos and there are gyro motors, there are traction motors, but sensors like an IMU, IR sensors.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:36.000
There's actually a lot of temperature and heat sensors, a myriad of sensors that actually all feed data that has to be processed.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:51.000
And through that process, a command to the gyros to tilt and lean the vehicle to keep it balanced or either to lean into a turn, it's very dependently based on our processing system.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
The prototype that we have now uses two i7s.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.000
At our end product, we should be using something that would power a smartphone today.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.000
One of the hurdles in our development is having the vehicle actually be more aware of its surroundings.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:16.000
So it's kind of like putting AI but also having good sensory perception of the road, of any kind of external influences or disturbances,

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:23.000
and having that all get computed and processed to allow for stability in all scenarios.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:30.000
On the heads-up display, you can see battery life, range, how much left you have in your procession budget.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.000
It's kind of like your artificial horizon.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:41.000
And also, it's basically a rolling smartphone, so all of the information on your smartphone will be on a side panel.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.000
Upgrading the hardware, the gyro can be done pretty easily.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.000
The gyros actually come and the battery pack come in its own modular unit.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:56.000
So you can upgrade the gyro output, you can upgrade the battery size, or both.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:04.000
So if you want a faster, more robust, more stabilized C1, it's pretty easy to upgrade that.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:11.000
The chassis is made out of steel. We could be using some kind of composite body for the interior as well.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.000
Parts count, we're one-tenth of a part of a car.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
Cars typically have around 24,000 parts.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:25.000
If you drive an Audi, it's 40,000. We only have 2,239.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.000
So it's pretty easy to manufacture, that's why we can make it affordable.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:36.000
In our audience, urban professionals, tech junkies, they have to have the first thing.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:55.000
They commute, they have a professional life, they still want to have fun, but at an affordable price.
