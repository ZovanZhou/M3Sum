00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
We have a party running.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
It's much more comfortable around them.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Yeah.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.000
This will be a cool like detail.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
What do you do when I'm like that?

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.000
I'm like on the kids parade.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Yeah, I'm like there for you.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Do you want to get in front of me?

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Oh my gosh.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Are you kidding me?

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:40.000
I'm alright.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:46.000
What's up?

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.000
People.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Are you serious?

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:02.000
I'm faster than that.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
I would have been in there soon enough.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
It's all quiet.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
Real quiet for the cops.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Oh yeah, why get arrested before the parade?

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Exactly.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
Woo woo, say hi.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000

How about the doggies?

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Yeah, where are the canine dogs?

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.000
Canine units.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.000
Where's the puppies?

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000

That was awesome.

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:15.100
I was taking pictures I couldn't see.

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:17.100
I stopped aiming. I just held it and started clicking.

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:19.100
Woo!

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:21.100
Click, click, click, click.

That was gross!

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:25.100
And all of them! Look at all the people!

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:27.100
Almost all of them, yeah. A lot of them.
