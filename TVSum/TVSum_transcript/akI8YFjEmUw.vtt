00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.440
There's a slogan that reads,

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:11.480
charging an electric car is charging the energy

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:12.700
of the earth.

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:14.400
This means that you get to play a role

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.740
in reducing greenhouse gas emissions

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.900
by driving eco-friendly vehicles.

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.840
An exhibition took place to showcase a wide range

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.380
of electric cars and related equipment.

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:27.000
Let's take a look.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.500
This is an electric car that emits less carbon dioxide

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:32.000
and air pollutants.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.900
If you connect this car with a charger,

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:37.500
it provides electric current through a transmission.

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.400
The Ministry of Environment, Seoul Metropolitan Government

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:43.000
and Korea Environment Corporation have jointly

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.100
established infrastructure for electric cars.

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.000
Last year, we established a charging system to feed

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
up to 500 electric cars.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.900
We plan to build another one with a capacity

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:57.100
of 2,600 vehicles this year.

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:59.600
And if this takes place, more electric cars will come

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.500
into place, which will lead to carbon emissions reduction

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:05.100
and air quality improvement.

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.300
This is a machine that accesses data of electric voltage

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:11.700
and current for efficient use of electric vehicles.

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.100
As it can estimate the efficiency rate,

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.000
it's useful when conducting research and development.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.300
The 2012 electric vehicle

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:23.400
and smart car exhibition was held on October 17th

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.800
to display eco-friendly electric vehicles

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:28.300
and related equipment.

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:30.900
Manufacturers of electric vehicles,

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.500
related industries including two-wheeled vehicles,

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:34.500
parts and materials,

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.500
charging systems participated in this exhibition.

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.100
This is a business fair that is aimed

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:41.800
at facilitating exchanges between professionals

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:44.300
in the electric vehicle industry.

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:46.900
This fair presented diverse electric vehicles,

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:49.300
auto parts and analysis system as well

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:52.300
as all electric battery-powered buses.

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:54.800
Overseas market seminars were held on the sideline

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:56.600
of the event to give information

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:59.900
to Korean electric car manufacturers.

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:03.100
Electric vehicles have reduced greenhouse gas emissions

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:04.600
and air pollutants.

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:07.400
To raise penetration rate of electric cars,

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:08.900
companies will have to endeavor

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:22.900
to develop advanced technologies.
