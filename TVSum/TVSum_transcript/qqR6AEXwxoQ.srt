1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,880
One of the things that most riders have difficulty learning and everybody wants to be able to do is to whip the bike

2
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:12,160
Basically whipping the bike is exactly kind of what it sounds like you off the face of the jump

3
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:19,360
Basically whip the bike out sideways so that the goal would be to get the bike either, you know parallel to the ground

4
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,220
Or beyond which some riders are able to do on

5
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:29,780
On sizable jumps, but really to start with it's just kind of kicking the bike out and it's a natural progression

6
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:35,340
Some people get confused as to what actually goes on in the whip and how you get the bike back

7
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:42,300
But when you do the whip correctly the bike and the momentum of your bike will actually bring you back around and straighten you out

8
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:43,420
Before you hit the ground

9
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:49,100
The key thing is to not obviously go above your ability level or try to go

10
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:55,780
You know too far down or just also making sure that you're on the right type of jump to be able to whip it on

11
00:00:57,260 --> 00:00:59,260
The key is

12
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:01,260
In the approach to the jump

13
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:03,700
We're actually almost leaning into it

14
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:08,580
Using the sidewalls of your tires to kind of bite as you take off the face of the jump

15
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:13,700
which will bring the bike actually flat as you leave the as your tires leave the

16
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:16,580
take off of the jump and

17
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:22,500
What momentum will do with it at that point is just kind of carry it back around and then over so there's a point

18
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:25,380
Where if you actually still framed it where you would be?

19
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:31,660
flat kind of this way and then as it comes around you're going to be out more to where your your

20
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:37,100
Tires are or sideways from where you were taking off and that whole thing will carry through

21
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:42,100
And it'll set you your bike back up straight as long as you do it, right?

22
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:44,740
The key is just very very small steps

23
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:46,740
learning to do it kind of

24
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:52,020
on real small jumps with maybe even a hip landing to where the takeoff would be

25
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:56,920
Straight to you, but the landing or the downside where you're shooting for would be at a an angle

26
00:01:57,580 --> 00:02:00,820
Across to where you could actually land on a on a slope

27
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:05,980
You know over to your left if you can whip to your left or over to your right if you're trying to do it

28
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:08,980
To your right that gives you a little bit more room for a margin of error

29
00:02:08,980 --> 00:02:14,740
To where you don't have to bring your bike all the way back perfectly straight, and you could land on the side slope

30
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:16,860
and it takes a little bit of the

31
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:19,500
Little bit of the risk out of it

32
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:39,180
So we're going to do a couple and kind of show you a little bit more of the technique in practice

33
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:51,500
So

34
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:00,380
As you can see

35
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:03,860
the whip is basically just a combination of

36
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:11,020
Taking off with the correct amount of lean and then using your body positioning to help bring the bike around

37
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:17,140
Depending on how much you know how far how little you got the bike out

38
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:20,420
The key is just to stay within your ability level

39
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:24,260
Start small and work up and up and up and make sure that

40
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:26,780
the jump has

41
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:33,060
When you're leaning against the jump your front end especially and your rear tire is not going to break loose on the face

42
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:35,740
Which would cause you to get kind of spiraling

43
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:41,540
Too far or it would make it very difficult to bring it back so stay within your ability level

44
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:47,140
Use your your body and your bike and let the momentum carry it across and you'll be whipping in no time

45
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:53,140
The whip is by far the most impressive looking trick and if you can master it you will be the envy of all your buddies

46
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:57,460
The important thing as I said earlier is just to take it slow

47
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:03,380
Analyze, you know the face of the jump find the right jump that you feel comfortable on

48
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:10,180
Begin the lean, you know, let the bike follow through in the momentum and your body position correct your

49
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:15,460
Correct your trajectory to get you back to straight as you get this feeling and you do it repetitively

50
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:20,580
You'll be able to go a little bit farther a little bit farther and and it can stay completely in control

51
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:25,620
Like I said, the whip is a lot of fun. It's it's fun to do. It's fun to watch and

52
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:39,940
Everybody should go try one
