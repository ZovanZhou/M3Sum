00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
If you didn't know already how to do it, here's how to change trailer, ATV, lawn tractor,

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:16.560
motorcycle, you know, and small vehicle tires just with a couple of screwdrivers or something

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.380
like that. They all work pretty much the same way.

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:23.460
First of all, there's three kinds of bead styles.

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:29.200
The first bead style is the tube style tire. It doesn't have very much of a bump or anything

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:35.040
on the inside of the rim to lock the rubber bead of the tire to the outside of the rim.

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.560
It just can be slipped right off by just stepping on the edge of the tire and it'll separate

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:41.720
the tire from the edge of the rim.

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:47.820
Tubeless tire design like car tires and many other things have a partially locking sealing

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:53.820
system to bead to rim and they're more difficult to separate. You may need to squish the tire

00:00:53.820 --> 00:01:00.820
in a vice, press it in a tire machine, or place the tire you're going to change right

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:06.600
in front of the wheel of a vehicle and slowly drive over the rubber part close to the rim

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.060
and that may break it for you.

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.960
It's usually stupid to try to beat it with a big hammer. You'll usually end up wrecking

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.520
your rim.

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:19.840
Another method is put the rubber part of the tire on your face of your jack and put it

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:26.360
underneath a high vehicle or something heavy and start jacking it up and that will create

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:31.120
a lot of pressure and a squishing edge to break the bead.

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:37.240
So once that's done, the way you change a tire is I like to set the nipple for the air

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:44.240
fill at least to that side or that side and start there. So you step on your tire and

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:51.240
you get the bead to drop to the lowest pocket inside your rim.

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.520
Then you get a pair of shoe divers and if you have no tube in there, you don't have

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:00.920
to worry, but if you have a tube, you have to be very careful not to prick your tube.

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:05.920
It's sometimes very important not to have that nipple either on the business area here

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:09.860
or where you're working, where you're starting. It gets in the way and it sometimes causes

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:15.520
you not to be able to get your bead to drop deeply into the pocket or if you have a tube,

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:20.160
it causes your tube to stick up there somewhat and your shoe diver will catch it and damage

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:21.000
it.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.560
So now I've got it stepped on and I've got my screwdiver carefully in there in case there's

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:31.360
a tube and I've got a lip pried up. Then I just get some soapy water or spray nine or

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:35.480
something like that and I lube the edges like so.

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:40.800
Now by taking small bites of the tire at a time, I start to unpeel it while still keeping

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:46.200
the pressure on the other side to keep the bead into the deep groove. It may be also

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:51.480
necessary sometimes to, say for example, pinch your rim a little bit with a vice grip right

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:57.300
there to stop the tire from slipping around at the same time you're unpeeling it off or

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:59.520
peeling it back on.

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:05.800
Well that took about one minute and it's all peeled. If you have a tube type tire, you

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:11.080
only have to peel one side off. You can just lift your tire up and get enough space in

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:16.360
there to get your hand in there and get out the tube. If you want to completely take the

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:21.680
tire off the rim, it's best to just flip it over like I did now and work from the back

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:27.400
side and stick your shoedivers here and there and pry the tire off that way. The second

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:29.920
side always comes off a lot easier.

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:34.200
My tire had a tube in it. That's the way I want it to be. But when you're installing

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:38.840
new tubes or even putting the old one back in, tubes very often have a right or left

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:45.600
side unless they're on a motorcycle. So that means the nipple is more off-center. And if

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:50.400
you put it in backwards, it may go in fine. As soon as you start blowing it up, all of

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:56.000
a sudden it'll suck itself in and you can't get a hold of the nipple anymore. And you've

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.360
got your tire all put back together. The only way to get your tire back apart is actually

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:04.000
put a hole in it and bleed the air out and start all over again, then patch your hole

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.520
if you put the tube in upside down. So that sucks.

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:12.080
To put it back on, I've got the valve stem over there, the vice grip opposite to it.

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:17.000
Now I'm going to stand as best as I can here. Sometimes it takes two people. Get that lip

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:22.640
into the deep groove and then get my shoediver and work this all the way around and slowly

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:30.720
peel it on by small amounts at a time. And that just went on in 30 seconds. Of course,

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:37.560
sometimes it takes longer. Now, especially on quad tires, to reseal the bead takes a

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:44.520
lot of pressure because it's that high-pressure locking bead because it's a low-pressure tire.

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:51.720
So my advice is to put spray nine or soapy water all the way around both sides of the

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:57.720
bead and then put your lots of air pressure in. And even park it in the sun because warming

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:07.400
it up helps it slip on too. And it's done. It's actually pretty easy. No use paying someone

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:11.480
25 bucks or something. It's just basic tools and a little bit of weight.

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:16.920
Last thing, I didn't mention that I took that quad tire to a shop and had them use their

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:23.160
machine to break the bead. ATV tires or quad tires are very low pressure so they don't

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:29.800
use air to give a tight fit to lock the bead to the rim. They have a bead locking design

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:34.640
which is very difficult to break the bead. The other methods I showed and talked about

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:39.920
probably won't work. So if you don't have one of those kind of machines, you better

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:44.280
go to a place and have someone break the bead for you. They have this kind of high-pressure

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:48.680
locking bead because the tires are low pressure and if you're doing hard cornering, you don't

00:05:48.680 --> 00:06:16.200
want the tire to all of a sudden flip off the rim and then roll your machine.
