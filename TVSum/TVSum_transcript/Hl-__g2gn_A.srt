00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,680
Hello, I'm Chef Dianne DeMayo and welcome to my kitchen.

2
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:07,440
Today we are making something super delicious as always.

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:09,920
We are making a Reuben sandwich with what?

4
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:15,600
Homemade corned beef, sauerkraut, and you can see the recipe on one of my bootleg tip videos.

5
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:20,960
We have some homemade pickles, again another wonderful bootleg tip video you can catch.

6
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:25,680
Swiss cheese, rye bread, we're making a very quick, easy Russian dressing.

7
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:29,600
And you wonder why I have a side of mustard here?

8
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:33,520
Because I have to take little tiny bites of the corned beef in between talking.

9
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:40,080
Okay, so let's build this sandwich.

10
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:43,680
First I'm going to get out rye bread.

11
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,120
Now you can use any type of bread you want.

12
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:46,240
You don't have to use rye bread.

13
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:47,520
You don't have to use dark rye bread.

14
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,200
I'm going to say this really quick because I can do it that way.

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:50,960
Get it on your plate.

16
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,560
Next we're going to start building.

17
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:54,560
I like fat so the fat stays on.

18
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:59,440
Layer one, layer two, there we go.

19
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:01,440
Bam.

20
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:08,640
Next I'm going to put another layer here of some queso cheese, Swiss.

21
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,640
Smash it.

22
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:14,640
On top of that, some bootleg sauerkraut.

23
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,640
Smash it.

24
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:22,640
And a quick and easy do-it-yourself Russian dressing.

25
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,640
But we're going to do the Russian dressing on the side.

26
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,640
Why?

27
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,640
Because I said so.

28
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,640
And I like to dip it in.

29
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,640
And sometimes I like to alternate with mustard because I am like that.

30
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,640
So all that really is is just some ketchup and mayonnaise.

31
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,640
You can do it the other way.

32
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,640
And then I'm going to put a little bit of the Russian dressing on the side.

33
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,640
And then I'm going to put a little bit of the Russian dressing on the side.

34
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,640
And then I'm going to put a little bit of the Russian dressing on the side.

35
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,640
But all that really is is just some ketchup and mayonnaise.

36
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,640
You can add some oregano, some garlic, some salt, some onions, some capers.

37
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:51,980
You can add some oregano, some garlic, some salt, some onions, some capers.

38
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:53,980
Whatever you want.

39
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:55,980
I like to keep it simple.

40
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:57,980
Ketchup and mayonnaise.

41
00:01:57,980 --> 00:01:59,980
I kind of like 1,000 eyelid dressing and I'm going to leave that there.

42
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:01,980
And here's the key to making this something super yum yum.

43
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:03,980
I'm going to slather one side with butter.

44
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:08,980
I'm gonna slather one side with butter.

45
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:16,820
And then we're gonna take it to the stove,

46
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:19,540
gonna get it hot on one side, flip that bad boy over,

47
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:22,440
put a little butter on the other side, and booyah.

48
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:25,140
It's gonna be a hot, crispy, buttery,

49
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:26,660
delicious Reuben sandwich.

50
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:27,980
Let's go to the stove.

51
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:30,420
Okay, my pan is nice and hot.

52
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:31,900
I got my buttery side.

53
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:34,020
I'm gonna do a quick and easy turn.

54
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:38,260
And while that's doing that,

55
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:40,060
I'm gonna sneak up on its back end

56
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:43,900
and get some butter all over that.

57
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:45,200
Give it some pressing.

58
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:48,560
All right, let's flip him over.

59
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:53,700
Oh yeah, look at that.

60
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:57,960
Reuben sandwich out of the pan, onto my plate.

61
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:02,020
Nice, crispy, buttery crust.

62
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:03,980
Got my knife.

63
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:05,860
We're gonna cut this in half.

64
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:13,900
Now it's time to taste.

65
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:17,980
But I almost forgot, gotta have a little pickle.

66
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:19,060
Just a little bit.

67
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:22,980
Oh, how much I love you.

68
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:24,500
You are my friend.

69
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:29,500
Okay, so a little bit of this, and there's a system to this.

70
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:30,620
One bite, ready?

71
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:43,460
Booyah, that was a touchdown.

72
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:45,020
Corned beef sandwich, homemade,

73
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:49,060
bootleg style sauerkraut, bootleg style pickle

74
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:50,780
with a little bit of Russian dressing,

75
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:53,460
Swiss cheese, rye bread, butter.

76
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:55,420
Best sandwich ever, and I will see you next week

77
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:57,500
with another delicious dish.

78
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:00,300
Hello, I am Chef Diane DeMayo, and welcome to my kitchen.

79
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:25,300
Today, we are making a corned beef.
