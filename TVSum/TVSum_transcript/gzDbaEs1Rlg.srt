There's nothing more frustrating than getting a puncture. In this short film I'm going to

2
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:15,280
explain how to repair a tyre using the compressor and sealant kit that's provided in ŠKODA

3
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:22,160
vehicles. Having the kit in your vehicle increases space and reduces weight. It works by distributing

4
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:28,160
a sealant around the inside of the tyre which seals punctures, allowing the tyre to be re-inflated.

5
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:32,680
We're away from the main road here and away from the main risk, so now we can start the

6
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:38,000
repair. First of all, apply the parking brake to prevent the vehicle moving accidentally.

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,600
Next, ensure the gear lever is in the neutral position for both manual and automatic transmission

8
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:50,480
types. And finally, make sure all passengers leave the vehicle and move to a safe area.

9
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:55,240
The kit works on punctures no more than 4mm in diameter. The kit cannot be used if the

10
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:59,680
wheel rim is damaged or the vehicle has been driven with an under-inflated or flat tyre

11
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:04,040
for an extended period. If you can't use the puncture repair kit, you will need to

12
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:09,880
arrange vehicle recovery by contacting ŠKODA roadside assistance. The kit comprises of

13
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:15,720
a compressor unit and a sealant kit, which also has a valve tool, spare tyre valve and

14
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:22,040
warning sticker in the bag. Now take the warning sticker and place it into the driver's field

15
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:27,400
of view. Then take the sealant bottle and give it a good shake. Make sure it's all mixed

16
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:37,060
up and then attach the filler tube to it like this and make sure it pierces the foil. Now

17
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:42,680
we remove the valve cap from the tyre valve itself. And using the removal tool, pop it

18
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:52,920
into the valve, unscrew and remove the valve completely. Don't worry about losing the valve

19
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:57,320
as you have a spare one in the kit. Now we get the fluid and attach the filler tube to

20
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:02,160
the tyre valve. Hold the sealant bottle upside down and fill the complete contents into the

21
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:07,200
tyre. It doesn't matter where the tyre valve is located when the vehicle is stationary

22
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:11,480
as the sealant will work its way around the tyre when the vehicle is driven. Disconnect

23
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:16,880
the filler tube from the tyre valve and refit the valve insert back into the valve using

24
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:24,600
the removal tool until it's tight. Now we take the compressor, which is this item here,

25
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:30,760
and open up the front cover which gives you access to the electrics which plug into the

26
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:38,400
12 volt socket inside your car and also the inflation tube that will attach to the actual

27
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:44,920
tyre itself. Now we attach the tube to the tyre valve like this. Connect this section

28
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:52,120
to your 12 volt socket and then start your engine. Turn the compressor on by the switch

29
00:02:52,120 --> 00:03:03,080
here. The tyre will start to inflate. Keep an eye on the gauge for pressures. These can

30
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:08,680
be found on the inside of your owner's manual or on the inside of your fuel filler flap.

31
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:12,880
It will take a few minutes to inflate. If the pressure stays below the required level,

32
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:17,360
drive the car a few metres to spread the sealant around the tyre. If it consistently stays

33
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:22,640
low then the tyre is too badly damaged and you will need to arrange a recovery. Once

34
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:28,520
inflated to the right pressure you can disconnect the tube, pop your tyre valve cover back on

35
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:32,560
and drive straight off. There are a couple of important points that you should be aware

36
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:37,560
of when first driving off. The tyre sealant will move around inside the tyre so it is

37
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:44,000
absolutely vital that you stop after 10 minutes and check the tyre pressure using the gauge.

38
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,800
If the tyre drops below the pressures outlined in the owner handbook then it could be that

39
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:53,000
the tyre is too badly damaged. If it's ok then you can drive on. But first remember

40
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:59,200
these points. The sealant means that you can drive at a maximum speed of 50 miles per hour.

41
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:04,920
Accelerate, brake and corner gently. It's a temporary measure so please see your local

42
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:11,040
Skoda retailer or tyre retailer immediately who can repair or replace the damaged tyre.

43
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:15,360
So I hope that's shown you just how easy it is to use the tyre repair kit. But please

44
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:20,040
remember this film is to be used as a guide and you must read the instruction manual thoroughly

45
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:26,120
before using the kit. And of course if you have any further questions please do not hesitate

46
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:30,440
to contact your local Skoda retailer. Thanks for watching this short film.
