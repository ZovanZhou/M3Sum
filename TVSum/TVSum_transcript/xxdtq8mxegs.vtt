Hi, I'm Dr. Wes Williams at Hillside Veterinary Clinic in Dallas, Texas.

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:29.400
We're going to talk a little bit today about ear health and ear cleaning.

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:34.040
So dogs develop dirt and debris and discharge in their ears and it has to be taken out.

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:38.800
And so we use solutions like the ear cleansing solution to help break up debris and dirt,

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:42.400
to help change the pH of the ears, to help make it where it's not a hospitable environment

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:46.020
for the bugs, and also to help with the odor.

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.800
We use ear cleaning solutions in addition to treatments as well.

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.360
The cleaning solution helps kill bacteria and yeast and can be used afterwards for regular

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:53.360
cleaning.

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:56.560
One thing to remember is that if you're treating and cleaning the ears at the same time, you

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:03.240
need to clean the ears 30 minutes prior to treatment.

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:05.840
So Sawyer has been kind enough today to be our model for our ear cleaner.

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:07.980
A couple of tips on cleaning ears.

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:11.420
First of all, we want to grip the ear at the base of the ear, but not so much that we're

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:12.880
causing pain.

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:17.800
Second of all, take your ear cleaning solution, apply a couple of drops into the ear canal,

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:22.760
massage it very well, making sure to work the solution into the ear canal, and then

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:28.440
take some cotton swabs and wipe away any debris from the outside.

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:30.480
A few more tips for cleaning your dog's ears.

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:33.960
When done with the cleaning, wipe off the tip of the ear cleaning solution to make sure

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.080
there's no dirt and debris left on there.

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:40.320
When applying it to the dog's ear, make sure not to jam the actual tip into the ear, and

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.240
when cleaning the ears, make sure not to jam any Q-tips or cotton into the actual ear,

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:46.800
only wipe off the debris from the outside.

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:49.700
If there are multiple pets in the house, it would be a good idea to have multiple bottles

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:52.840
so you don't spread microbes back and forth from dog to dog.

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:56.880
If you have any questions about ear cleaning, your local veterinarian is a great source

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:21.200
for information.
