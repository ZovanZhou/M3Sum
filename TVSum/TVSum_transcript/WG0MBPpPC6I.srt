00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,040
Hello I am Chef Diane DeMaio and welcome to my kitchen. Today I am making a

2
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:08,760
chicken torta and I'm using a special bootleg tip breadcrumb with cotija

3
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:13,040
cheese and cilantro so make sure to check out that video. But today we are

4
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:18,000
making a very authentic torta using black beans, any kind of black beans that

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,440
we're gonna fry up, fresh avocado, we have some chipotle peppers, some jalapeno

6
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:28,080
oopsie, jalapeno peppers, queso blanco, you can use Oaxacan cheese or any type of

7
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:31,760
panela cheese that you want and if you can't find that use mozzarella. We have

8
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:37,600
thinly sliced chicken breast and a couple of eggs. Alright let's get cooking.

9
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:40,520
I'm gonna do a little prep and then we're gonna get the food over to the

10
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:44,640
stove. First thing first gonna get my tomatoes cut. I like to use Roma tomatoes

11
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,840
just because I like Roma tomatoes but you can use beefsteak tomatoes, you can

12
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:51,560
use any type of tomatoes. A tomato is a tomato, not necessarily, but I like my

13
00:00:51,560 --> 00:01:00,640
Roma tomatoes. Alright just enough for the sandwich on the plate. Cheese, I love

14
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:06,800
this cheese. It's salty, it tastes good, it's kind of like a mozzarella if you will.

15
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:11,160
That's good. This melts very well. Some cheese from Mexico they don't melt.

16
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:17,440
You'll find one that you like and use it. Alright, an avocado. I don't like my

17
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:21,760
avocado too mushy, I like it just right.

18
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:32,400
Bam. Get this on the plate like that. Next, yes you got it, we are going to bread our

19
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:37,000
chicken. Okay this is an easy process. First what I do is I get my eggs in a

20
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,440
bowl, whisk it a little bit and then we're gonna dip our chicken into the

21
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:43,960
eggs and then into the breading and that's it. Then we're gonna go to the

22
00:01:43,960 --> 00:02:01,720
fryer. Easy whisk. And there we go. And the huevos. Into the crumbs. Make sure it's nice and

23
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:09,880
crummy. And onto the plate. We're gonna do just one more piece because we want a

24
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:16,320
very fat juicy sandwich. Alright, there we go.

25
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:28,160
And there you go. I got my two pieces and I am ready to go to the stove. First

26
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:34,560
thing I like to do, as always, get extra fat into my meals. How am I gonna do that?

27
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:43,400
I'm going to butter my bread and make it nice and super crispy. Oil the pan, flame

28
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:53,920
is nice, and in goes my bread. Meanwhile, I have my fryer oil ready to go and I'm

29
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:57,440
gonna get my chicken inside.

30
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:08,400
While that's going on here, I'm gonna get my bread out of the pan, get some beans

31
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:18,280
into the pan, and just do a nice little heat smash. So I have some, how you say,

32
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:24,320
lightly fried beans. I think about one more minute for my chicken and it's

33
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:29,600
ready to come out. You can do this same recipe with steak, like a milanesa. You

34
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:33,800
could do it with fish if you wanted to, or you can do it with actually pork and

35
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:38,520
make the same torta sandwich. That's right, you can. Alright, my beans are about

36
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:47,600
done. I gave it a little more smashy smash. Okay, chicken's coming out.

37
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:56,800
Oh yeah baby, look at that. Cilantro still nice and green. Yeah. Okay, and it goes,

38
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:03,240
and I'm gonna do it while I'm here. Yeah, that's right. I'm just gonna sear some of

39
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:08,720
this bean on now. Okay, we are now going to do something that takes a lot of

40
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:14,040
concentration, extremely serious. We're going to build a torta. We have our black

41
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:20,640
beans already at the bottom layer. That's right. I'm gonna add some cheese. Then I'm

42
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:27,080
gonna do some tomatoes. I'm concentrating very hard, you have to. There you go.

43
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:43,320
Tomatoes. Shall we? Okay, we shall. Now we're going to add chipotle sauce on one

44
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:53,040
side like this. Yes, there it is. Then we're going to smother that with some mayonnaise

45
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,880
because I can.

46
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:11,240
Lettuce, and I'm gonna give it a nice little crunch so it kind of breaks it up.

47
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:15,680
You could cut it up into little slicks, little tiny tiny tiny tiny tiny tiny

48
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:20,840
slivers, but why? Why? What's the point? And then to make this sandwich, ultimately

49
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:26,440
the chicken torta, we are going to add pickled jalapenos. That's right.

50
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:31,520
We're just gonna lay it across. Okay, I got my lettuce on, I got my jalapeno

51
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:44,280
peppers, and that's right. Fresh avocado going on there and there. I'm gonna have to break it up and

52
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:49,720
smoosh it in. And the question here is how I'm gonna wrap my mouth around this.

53
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:58,440
All right, that's it. Crowding this bad boy. Sandwiches of sandwiches. The chicken

54
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:02,520
torta, breaded in breadcrumbs, cotija cheese with a little bit of cilantro,

55
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:08,480
black beans, queso blanco. Bam! And now I'm ready to eat this.

56
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:19,280
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Okay, that is too good. Mexican street food ain't got nothing on

57
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:23,040
me. Don't forget to check out my bootleg tip for my breadcrumb and cotija cheese

58
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:26,680
mixture, and I will see you next week with another super tasty dish. Ciao.

59
