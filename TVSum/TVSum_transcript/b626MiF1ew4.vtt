00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:18.400
I like really hit the gym, like really thorough that night.

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:19.680
We call ourselves Charlotte Parkour.

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.520
We're basically, we are the, we started training parkour about, the first of us started about

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:31.000
70 years ago here at UNC Charlotte and since then we've grown into a bigger group.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.360
Other people have started to join us, we've progressed, a lot of us have learned, met

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:38.120
other people.

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:42.200
Parkour is a discipline of training your mind and body to overcome obstacles.

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:47.480
We train this by running, jumping, climbing, vaulting, balancing, things like that.

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:52.240
If you want to try a new jump, you're not just, you don't just physically jump, at the

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:57.560
same time you have to overcome the mental fear and like the, overcoming the obstacle

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:58.560
process.

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:03.360
So, it's a process of breaking down obstacles like in your head and figuring out the different

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:08.120
parts and training those parts, bringing it back together and then it's also a process

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:09.720
of facing the fear.

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.600
So, you might be physically capable of doing a new jump or some new move, but at the same

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:20.040
time there's a fear like telling you like, oh you're going to get hurt and you have to

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.680
suppress that fear, like learn to control it and at the same time listen to it, you

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:29.920
know, know when it's right and when you know better.

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:35.360
We teach now, we teach classes here, we teach seminars, hoping to share what we know with

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:36.360
other people.

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.240
Really, everyone's kind of been standing around, I just want everyone really to kind of do

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:44.480
like this on each leg, this is going to just kind of get our ankles warmed up a little

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:49.600
bit.

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:53.760
While we're doing this, let's go ahead and warm up our wrists some.

00:01:53.760 --> 00:02:08.160
So, just kind of roll your wrists like this.

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.760
Rolls are something that can save your life or your knee.

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:14.780
I tore two muscles in my knee because I fell off a building and I didn't roll.

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:18.840
My leg buckled to the side, but had I actually rolled, I would have been okay.

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:22.440
Core decision, so this is something that will definitely come in handy and if you've ever

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:25.920
seen people do the dive rolls, that's what I'm going to be teaching you too.

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.600
So we'll start with rolls on the ground, fall rolls and then dive rolls.

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:40.840
Push off and really drive your shoulder, everything into the ground.

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:46.480
The way that I learned best to do this is that you swing with your foot through, that'll

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:50.000
provide your body with the motion up you need and your hands are just there to support you

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.360
when you come back down.

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:57.280
So it's a little bit weird, but basically watch how I'm using my right foot on the jump,

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:01.360
that'll pick me up, my hands are only there to support me on the way back down.

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:17.600
So coming through, I'll just go here.

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:31.400
And aquÃ­ vamos.

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:33.400
Yeah, five glasses for you then.

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:35.400
Alright, who's not the best?

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:36.400
You ready?

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:37.400
Think butterfly, dude.

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:38.400
Smile about it.

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:39.400
You ready? Let's go.

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:41.400
Yeah!

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:42.400
Nice one, Mia.

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:43.400
Scoot on over.

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:44.400
That's from that girl.

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:45.400
Please do.

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:50.400
There was some episode of Avatar, this guy's teasing a prison guard.

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:53.400
He's like, okay, who's pinching whose nipple?

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:59.400
Boom.
