00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
New details tonight about a train accident we first told you during our 4 o'clock newscast.

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:06.480
Take a look from our CBS Atlanta Sky Eye.

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:10.080
You can see the accident totaled that red car.

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:13.120
It all happened this afternoon where Highway 92

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:16.020
and Mosley Road crossover train tracks in Douglasville.

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.560
CBS Atlanta's Steve Kiggins joins us from the train crossing tonight.

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.800
Steve, is this accident an isolated event?

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:25.020
You know what, Stephanie?

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:25.840
It's really not.

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:31.360
And the driver of that vehicle was thankfully able to get out of her car with plenty of time to spare

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:33.020
before that train came along.

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:36.220
Now the problem may be the way that the asphalt was laid.

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:41.040
There's about a six-inch drop between the surface of the road and the railroad ties.

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.060
And neighbors here say cars get stuck there a lot.

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:47.160
It was just like a boom.

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:48.160
You know, screeching.

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:51.480
And then when it went down the tracks with it, it was awful.

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.560
Beverly Woods and her husband Robert had a front row seat to this wreck of an afternoon.

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:58.240
She's an elderly lady, you know.

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:01.280
She, you know, ain't judging her distance right.

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:03.520
But that's what happened.

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:06.240
She ran off too far over here and she got stuck.

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.640
From CBS Atlanta's Sky Eye, you can see what's left of this car

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:12.360
after an oncoming train smashed into it.

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.440
The locomotive pushed the vehicle 1,000 feet before finally stopping.

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:19.640
The driver was able to get out of the car before the collision.

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:23.040
The neighbors say cars get stuck on the tracks all too often.

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:28.440
We've been having truckers getting stuck out here, vehicles getting stuck on the tracks.

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:33.400
I've helped quite a few, maybe four or five people get off the tracks.

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:39.520
Broad Street and Mosley Road is Douglasville's most accident-prone railroad crossing.

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:42.280
Apart from several collisions in the past year,

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:47.400
there have been 22 documented incidents of cars getting stuck on the tracks.

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:51.600
Norfolk Southern repaved the crossing, but left a considerable drop-off

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.480
instead of a tapering slope.

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:58.920
GDOT re-striped the road, but Woods doesn't think that's enough to keep drivers on the road.

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:06.000
No matter how much work they do, I think it's just people not aware of how far to turn.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.840
Beverly would rather see the crossing shut down before someone gets seriously hurt.

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:12.280
I think they should close it up.

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:17.440
If I was to see somebody get killed, I'd probably die myself.

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:21.440
Now we are still waiting to hear back from Norfolk Southern to see if they have any plans

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:25.480
to make improvements at this crossing to try and minimize collisions.

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:43.480
We are live in Douglasville, Steve Kiggins, CBS Atlanta News.
