00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,760
Hey, Rex here with 2 Wheel Oklahoma here in Dallas.

2
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:13,240
I ran into Felipe Smage.

3
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:14,320
The Spanish trials rider.

4
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:15,400
That's right.

5
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:17,600
You may have seen these guys on America's Got Talent.

6
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:20,280
How long have you guys been riding?

7
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:25,640
We've been riding since we were around 10 or 11, so about 13 or 14 years.

8
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:26,640
Wow, okay.

9
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:31,360
We've been going to town for quite a while now, but to ride trials it takes that long

10
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:32,360
to even ride the bike.

11
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:33,360
Exactly.

12
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:36,880
It takes a long time, but once you get to that level it's one of the most fun sports

13
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:38,400
you can do.

14
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:39,400
It is a lot of fun.

15
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:40,400
It's great exercise too.

16
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:42,400
I understand you guys compete, right?

17
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:44,480
Yeah, actually I try to compete.

18
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:46,280
My brother, he competes very well.

19
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:48,880
He's the four time national champion.

20
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:49,880
I hold my own.

21
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:53,200
I ride pro class very long with him, but usually he's at the front of the pack.

22
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:54,920
I'm just trying to beat a couple guys.

23
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:55,920
Right.

24
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:57,400
I'm just trying to get in there, though, both competing.

25
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:58,400
What's been the reaction?

26
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:04,080
I bet all the guys, like Sherco and Gas Gas, the guys that make trials bikes probably just

27
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:07,160
think you're the greatest thing to come along.

28
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:10,160
Have you increased awareness of the sport?

29
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:12,920
That was actually not only increased awareness of the sport, because that was one thing that

30
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:14,600
we really shoot for.

31
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:15,600
We love the sport.

32
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:16,600
We love to spread it.

33
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:20,080
That's kind of why we travel around doing demos, to bring the sport to new people.

34
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,800
There's no better medium than national live television.

35
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:27,960
Not only were we able to bring and grow what we're doing in our shows and our name, but

36
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:31,920
also the sport of trials, and then even motorcycling as a whole, because it's got a very negative

37
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,560
aspect by a lot of the world.

38
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:38,200
They think of motorcycles, they think of pollution, they think of death, they think of injury.

39
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:42,200
What we did, we were able to bring it into a tight, confined area, indoor, in a building,

40
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,920
in downtown LA.

41
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,260
By jumping these barriers, we were able to open some eyes and make people realize that

42
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:49,520
maybe the motorcycles aren't such a bad thing.

43
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,880
That was a really big thing that we brought from the show.

44
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:55,560
It was a really cool experience, and to be able to open up people's eyes in that aspect

45
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:56,560
was really awesome.

46
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:59,320
And you scored a gig at the International Motorcycle Show.

47
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:01,320
And we're here after it, so it was all good for sure.

48
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:03,320
So you're going to go around all 12 of them, right?

49
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:04,320
Yep, yep.

50
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,320
That's great.

51
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:06,320
We got one down two weeks ago in San Mateo.

52
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:07,320
We're here in Dallas, Texas.

53
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:08,320
It was a while getting here.

54
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:09,320
We had some transmission issues, tire blowouts.

55
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:10,320
Oh, really?

56
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:14,960
I mean, still haven't slept since we left to leave here two days ago.

57
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:15,960
Oh, really?

58
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:16,960
We're running on thin right now.

59
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,960
It seems like you're really a rock star.

60
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:19,960
Yeah.

61
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,960
So this is what that feels like.

62
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:22,960
Oh, cool.

63
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:23,960
In that case, wow.

64
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:26,960
Well, there's some other things that go along with that, too.

65
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:27,960
Yeah, so it's been really good.

66
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:31,560
We're going to do the whole series, and we've really been able to get our name out there,

67
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:32,560
and we're booking more shows.

68
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:35,960
And we're doing what we really want to do, which is entertain people on our bikes.

69
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:40,840
That's what we've been working for years to be able to do, and now that we have that ability

70
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:43,440
and the option to do it, we're pushing for more.

71
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:44,880
Doing what you love for a living.

72
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:45,880
What a great idea.

73
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:49,520
Well, we're going to go have a seat and watch the show, and I wish you luck, man.

74
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,520
Hey, thanks a lot.

75
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,520
Enjoy the show.

76
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,520
We need somebody to jump over.

77
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53,520
This guy in?

78
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,520
Thanks a lot, man.

79
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,520
Nice to meet you.

80
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,520
Thanks.

81
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,520
Thank you for watching.

82
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,520
Come on over to the tent, get some autographs from these guys.

83
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,520
We've got some free posters for you.

84
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:06,520
You can get some of these awesome GOAT shirts we've got.

85
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,000
Give these guys a high five.

86
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Give them a handshake.

87
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
They're tired.

88
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:24,600
Give them some treats and give them some support too.

89
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:33,800
Isn't that great.
