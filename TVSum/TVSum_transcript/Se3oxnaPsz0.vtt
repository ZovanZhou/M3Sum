00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.600
A deadly killer bee attack that was all caught on tape and you're gonna see it right now on KLD News 13 and only on KLD News 13.

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:14.000
Sonu Wasu is in Bisbee tonight with people that witnessed this terrible incident.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:21.200
We are inside an outbuilding on a farm here in Bisbee where this massive killer bee hive was located.

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:25.500
Right up there in the ceiling of this building you can see they've cut out a hole up there.

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:33.800
Right there was a 200 pound hive big enough we're told to hold more than 250,000 killer bees.

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:39.400
It is the attack of the killer bees. Sound like a horror flick? This is very real.

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:43.200
An animal farm located off Highway 80 in Bisbee.

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.700
Freelance videographer Al Signore shot this unbelievable footage.

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.000
A thousand pound boar under attack.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.000
This is the worst one I've seen.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.600
And it got worse when the swarm turned its fury on the farmers.

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.900
I jumped into my truck and unfortunately the passenger window was partly open.

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:06.000
So they came in in a black cloud. Many, many. So I had to swap them out the driver's window.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.400
And it was pretty, pretty bad.

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.000
Pretty bad. Did you get stung?

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Four or five times.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.900
This hand that did the swatting really looked like I'd been boxing without gloves.

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.800
When everyone else runs this guy comes buzzing in.

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:21.600
Reid Booth calls himself the killer bee guy.

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.000
I do most of the Africanized bee removal for Sheriff, Police, Fire, Border Patrol.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.300
Booth says the bees seem to be feistier this year.

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:31.300
This year is worse than I've seen in 10 years.

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:35.500
A thousand pound peg is a huge thing and has skin like that and fat like that on it.

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:37.600
So I'm kind of surprised that it did kill it.

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:43.100
Even in a bee suit and helmet attacking a hive filled with a quarter million aggressive bees is not easy.

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:47.300
And it was extremely hot to get up in there and work because of probably 180 degrees.

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:50.100
It was really something else. And I ended up with heat stroke actually.

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.300
Heat stroke and burning stings.

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:55.500
Sadly, the 1,000 pound boar did not survive.

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:01.800
Another pregnant 800 pound sow went into a coma, lost all her babies, and is now recovering.

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:05.600
Now experts say if you do happen to see such a hive on your property,

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.300
do not try to eradicate these bees yourself.

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:12.400
It is a very dangerous job that should be left up to professionals.

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:16.300
In Bisbee, Sonu Basu, KOLD News 13, live local late breaking.

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:17.100
Thank you, Sonu.
