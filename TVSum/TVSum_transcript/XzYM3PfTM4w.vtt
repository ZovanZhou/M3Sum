00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000
As I'm sure you've learned, your GMC really lives up to its never say never reputation,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.120
one that will continue for a long time.

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.080
Yet there comes a time when the tires your GMC came with need to be replaced.

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:21.080
That's why your GMC certified service experts are there to help when it's time for new ones.

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:25.720
All tires wear out, but rotation helps them last longer and wear out more evenly so you

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:28.080
can replace all four at once.

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.120
New tires generally grip the road better than tires that have some miles on them.

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:35.080
See how this tire is worn more on one side than the other?

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:38.920
The owner probably didn't rotate his tires regularly.

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:44.400
GMC recommends rotating your tires every time you change your oil or 7,500 miles.

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:48.680
Your certified service experts will use a tread depth measurement tool like this to

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:51.000
see if your tires need replacing.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
You can also easily do it yourself using a penny.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.880
Insert the penny into the tire tread.

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:59.520
If the tread reaches Lincoln's forehead, the tread is good.

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:04.880
If not, you'll want to visit the GMC certified service experts for new tires because of course

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:08.440
riding on bald tires is definitely a safety hazard.

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:10.320
You also need proper tire balance.

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.680
An unbalanced or improperly balanced tire and wheel can make your car vibrate as well

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:16.760
as create uneven tread wear.

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:21.160
Bent wheels or a misaligned suspension can also produce uneven tread wear and cause tires

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:25.120
to lose air, so watch out for those sneaky potholes and curbs.

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:28.200
I hope you learned a few things about tire care and replacement.

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.280
