Hey people, so have you ever wondered

5
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
आप अगर अपने डॉक की कुछ बिमारी

6
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
या फिर किसी तकलीफ को

7
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
चेक अप करवाएं जाएंगे तो कहां जायेंगे?

8
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
So you know, anyone can call us for emergency services.

9
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Call, call, eh... which number?

10
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Emergency number is there, isn't it?

11
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Emergency number?

12
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
It's 9810162807

13
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Ma'am any tips you would like to give to

14
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
your viewers for their

15
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
docking and such. Just keep your pet clean

16
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
and healthy and be

17
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
very friendly with them. Treat them as your

18
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
kid and just

19
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
hang out well!

20
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Thank you, ma'am. Thank you very much, ma'am.

21
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
So hang out well as ma'am said.

22
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Thank you.

23
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Hey people!

24
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
So look at

25
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
this awesomeness!

26
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
German

27
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Shepherd Dogs!

28
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Competing with each other!

29
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
This is the best one.

30
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
This is our personal favourite.

31
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
And here they are going.

32
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Come on, come on.

33
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
What do you think about it?

34
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
This is a personality test, okay?

35
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
The way they walk,

36
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
the way they bark,

37
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
and everything is being checked.

38
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Exactly.

39
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Here, especially from Australia,

40
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
a judge has come

41
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
who is

42
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
judging the dogs according to

43
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
their agility, their personality,

44
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
their moves and all the stuff.

45
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Guys, listen to that.

46
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
This one, she's the lady.

47
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
She's the lady.

48
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Dori Wander Prestige Trophy.

49
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Look, he's walking nice,

50
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
he's walking nice.

51
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
How do you think about it, Arpit?

52
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Have you ever watched it before?

53
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
No, I really have never.

54
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I never got a chance to go to a dog show.

55
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
And guys, there's a show going on there too.

56
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
We'll check that out too.

57
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Yes, thank you.

58
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Thanks to Ronaldo for taking me.

59
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I know.

60
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
You're too good, man.

61
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Now we'll take you to a mixed dog breed show.

62
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
And that's going on there.

63
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Let's check it out.

64
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
We're at San Montmere School right now.

65
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
So let's go.

66
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
This is Labrador Retriever.

67
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Okay, this is Labrador.

68
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
And you can check out

69
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
here.

70
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Come on, guys.

71
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
We'll show you

72
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
here.

73
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Check out chicks too.

74
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Wrong thing.

75
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
It's my forest to be wrong.

76
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Wait, wait.

77
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
He's busy.

78
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Next round.

79
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Irish Wolf Terrier.

80
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
No, Irish Wolfhound.

81
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I guess so.

82
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
And this is,

83
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I don't know.

84
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I can see the Kinkies.

85
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
And this is Udu.

86
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Hi, I'm Udu.

87
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Cutie.

88
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
She's not here.

89
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Do you want a biscuit?

90
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
We're at Niti Bagh.

91
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Dog Saloon.

92
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
It's a bit spicy here.

93
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Pet Saloon, that is Niti Bagh,

94
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
has dogs here.

95
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Before and after,

96
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
you can view. You can check out.

97
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
You can bring your dogs here.

98
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
You can groom your dogs here.

99
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
You can groom them

100
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
and clean them up.

101
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
You can make them

102
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
out.

103
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
And see this cutie.

104
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I met Karan sir.

105
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Exactly.

106
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Let's go there. So many people are there.

107
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
See people, you can bring your dogs here.

108
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Even if they don't bring them,

109
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
you can still come here and buy things for them.

110
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
You can learn about dogs.

111
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
You can talk about them with different people.

112
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
With known people.

113
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
And now, let's see.

114
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
We're going to that place.

115
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
There you'll find awesome breeds,

116
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
awesome collection of people

117
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
from different backgrounds,

118
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
from different niches.

119
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
We should go to that.

120
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Which breed is that?

121
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
That is a San Bernard.

122
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Hey Azhar.

123
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Good morning. Is this your dog?

124
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
It's a nice dog. What's his name?

125
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Ustad.

126
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
His dog's name is Ustad.

127
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Actually we're people from Duwang.

128
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
And we're a promotion club.

129
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
So,

130
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
The break is over.

131
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
What's his name?

132
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Tiger.

133
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Tiger.

134
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Look at guys.

135
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Awesome.

136
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
He got scared.

137
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
It's a Cocker Spaniel.

138
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
And we guess so another round of

139
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
competition is gonna happen here.

140
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
And no, it won't be a race

141
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
because dogs are of different breeds.

142
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
So, it won't be a fair competition

143
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
for them.

144
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
But let's see what happens now.

145
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
So, this is a race.

146
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
And here is Bikini Malia.

147
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Let's see.

148
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Dimension is the winner.

149
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
He's running so fast.

150
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
That Labrador is running after the girl.

151
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
He's running after her.

152
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Yeah!

153
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
She left everyone.

154
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Correct.

155
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
That is Julie.

156
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
And she's very fast.

157
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
And yeah.

158
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
So, people.

159
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Hope you enjoyed. You had fun.

160
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
We're at the GST club.

161
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Talk show organized by

162
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Kennel Club of India.

163
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
You can check the show schedule

164
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000

165
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
And hope you had fun.

166
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
We had lots of fun.

167
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
We saw awesome dogs.

168
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Awesome breeds.

169
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
And hopefully

170
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
we hope

171
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
you have a good place for dogs.

172
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
So, love people.

173
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Obviously love people and also love animals.

174
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Let the peace fall upon earth.

175
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Adios.

176
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Thanks for watching.
