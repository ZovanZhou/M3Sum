Dogs and cats naturally wear down their nails while walking, running, or scratching trees.

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:20.320
However, some animals don't, and this can be a problem. Cutting the nails can be a difficult

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:27.240
problem for both of you. Initially, it seems that it will be impossible, but with love

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:33.040
and patience, it can be done. Sometimes your dog or cat may be uncomfortable when you are

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:39.160
handling parts of the body that he isn't used to having touched. Get him to lie down, try

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:46.120
to relax him, and slowly get him used to allowing you to touch his ears, legs, feet, and paws.

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:52.560
This will be helpful for when you need to visit the vet or your groomer. Like humans,

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:57.840
dogs have two parts to their nails. The end of the nail is dead. The other part, closest

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:03.060
to the paw, has small veins. Sometimes you can see where the vein is, but this depends

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:08.280
on the color of the nail. It is important not to cut too close to the paw, as this will

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:15.280
make him bleed. The first time you cut your dog's nails, let him smell the scissors or

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:22.280
nail clippers. Let him get used to them. Slowly, when the dog is relaxed, cut one nail at a

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:29.280
time, talking to him the whole time. Consult your vet or pet shop if you have any questions.

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:39.280
Make sure you look for the dewclaw and cut the nail, because sometimes this can cause

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:46.280
problems and become embedded in the skin. Gloria nail clippers and scissors remain very

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:52.280
sharp. Other clippers or scissors blunt very quickly, and instead of cutting the nails,

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:57.280
they can splinter or break them. If your clippers or scissors do not cut properly, please change

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:04.280
them for new ones. Your dog will love that you spend time taking care of him. Do you

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:11.280
