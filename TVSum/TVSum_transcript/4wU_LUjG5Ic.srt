00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Bike Friendly Cities is a European project that wants to get cities cycling.

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,560
Southend-on-Sea in Cambridge in the UK, Middelburg and the province of Zeeland in the Netherlands,

3
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:18,880
Boulogne in France and Kortrijk in Belgium are all working together to promote cycling

4
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:20,200
in their cities.

5
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:25,780
In summer 2013, these cities held bike parades and invited everyone to come along, dress

6
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:32,600
up and celebrate cycling.

7
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:36,360
My name's Steve and this is Chris and we're on Southend Cycle Ride.

8
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:42,320
We like cycling because it's out in the fresh air, you make lots of new friends and have

9
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:43,320
a really good time.

10
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:44,320
It's good for the environment as well.

11
00:00:44,320 --> 00:01:02,740
It's nice to get out on the bike and meet other people.

12
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:04,740
Do you cycle to work?

13
00:01:04,740 --> 00:01:05,740
Yes, daily.

14
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:06,740
Daily?

15
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:07,740
Every day you go to work on your bicycles?

16
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:14,740
Yes.

17
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:15,740
Hi, I'm Kritika.

18
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:21,740
I love cycling because it's fun, it keeps me fit, it's cheap and it keeps my carbon

19
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:22,740
footprint down.

20
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:35,740
I'm Fran and I like cycling because it's cheap, I get there fast and I get a cheap

21
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:37,740
ride.

22
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:42,740
I really have a race bicycle.

23
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:47,740
Some do it on the professional side, others do it for leisure.

24
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:53,740
For me it's also a matter of moving and taking out the stress.

25
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:56,740
The whole week is a lot of stress.

26
00:01:56,740 --> 00:02:04,740
When the weather is a bit fine, like today, I can do some cycling.

27
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:07,740
I live in Kortrijk in Belgium.

28
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:12,740
The bike is the best way to find our way in the city.

29
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:39,740
It inspires me as well.

30
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:43,740
Bye.

31
00:02:43,740 --> 00:03:12,740
Bye.
