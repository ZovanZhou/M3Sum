00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
New details tonight about a train accident we first told you during our 4 o'clock newscast.

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:06,480
Take a look from our CBS Atlanta Sky Eye.

3
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:10,080
You can see the accident totaled that red car.

4
00:00:10,420 --> 00:00:13,120
It all happened this afternoon where Highway 92

5
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:16,020
and Mosley Road crossover train tracks in Douglasville.

6
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:19,560
CBS Atlanta's Steve Kiggins joins us from the train crossing tonight.

7
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:22,800
Steve, is this accident an isolated event?

8
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:25,020
You know what, Stephanie?

9
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:25,840
It's really not.

10
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:31,360
And the driver of that vehicle was thankfully able to get out of her car with plenty of time to spare

11
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:33,020
before that train came along.

12
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:36,220
Now the problem may be the way that the asphalt was laid.

13
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:41,040
There's about a six-inch drop between the surface of the road and the railroad ties.

14
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:44,060
And neighbors here say cars get stuck there a lot.

15
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:47,160
It was just like a boom.

16
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:48,160
You know, screeching.

17
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:51,480
And then when it went down the tracks with it, it was awful.

18
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:56,560
Beverly Woods and her husband Robert had a front row seat to this wreck of an afternoon.

19
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:58,240
She's an elderly lady, you know.

20
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:01,280
She, you know, ain't judging her distance right.

21
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:03,520
But that's what happened.

22
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:06,240
She ran off too far over here and she got stuck.

23
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:09,640
From CBS Atlanta's Sky Eye, you can see what's left of this car

24
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:12,360
after an oncoming train smashed into it.

25
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:16,440
The locomotive pushed the vehicle 1,000 feet before finally stopping.

26
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:19,640
The driver was able to get out of the car before the collision.

27
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:23,040
The neighbors say cars get stuck on the tracks all too often.

28
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:28,440
We've been having truckers getting stuck out here, vehicles getting stuck on the tracks.

29
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:33,400
I've helped quite a few, maybe four or five people get off the tracks.

30
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:39,520
Broad Street and Mosley Road is Douglasville's most accident-prone railroad crossing.

31
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:42,280
Apart from several collisions in the past year,

32
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:47,400
there have been 22 documented incidents of cars getting stuck on the tracks.

33
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:51,600
Norfolk Southern repaved the crossing, but left a considerable drop-off

34
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,480
instead of a tapering slope.

35
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:58,920
GDOT re-striped the road, but Woods doesn't think that's enough to keep drivers on the road.

36
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:06,000
No matter how much work they do, I think it's just people not aware of how far to turn.

37
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,840
Beverly would rather see the crossing shut down before someone gets seriously hurt.

38
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,280
I think they should close it up.

39
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:17,440
If I was to see somebody get killed, I'd probably die myself.

40
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:21,440
Now we are still waiting to hear back from Norfolk Southern to see if they have any plans

41
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:25,480
to make improvements at this crossing to try and minimize collisions.

42
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:43,480
We are live in Douglasville, Steve Kiggins, CBS Atlanta News.
