00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.000
How did you get started in this?

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:17.840
My daddy was a beekeeper and I kind of followed along with him.

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:25.000
And after I got through teaching, why I added a few more hives.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.520
They are undertaker bees, guard bees, nursery bees.

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:33.720
They go through all those different stages in the hive.

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:40.960
Cans of syrup that we feed the new hives when we start them.

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:46.760
And there's one that goes on each hive and the bees are able to get the syrup out of

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:51.480
these cans when they're sitting upside down by the cloth here.

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:58.240
We can go over here and open up a hive and look and see what the bees are doing.

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:04.800
Now you going to get in trouble with those bees by opening up that hive?

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:05.800
No.

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:10.960
See they're working on a honey super now.

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:18.320
They're building new comb here, new comb here on the, this is what we start with and they

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:21.680
can see where they're building the new comb.

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:23.880
How come they don't get mad at you?

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:29.000
Because I'm handling carefully and I'm gentle and they like my smell.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.400
They know who you are.

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:31.400
Yes.

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:34.040
There's a drone bee.

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:35.120
Which one is he?

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:36.120
This big guy right there?

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:37.120
Yeah.

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:38.920
How do you know he's a drone bee?

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:40.800
Because of the size of him.

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:43.440
He's got a rounded butt.

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:48.120
And they're filling the honey super from the maples and the early blooming flowers here

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:49.120
in Washington.

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:56.680
There'd be about 60 pounds of honey in that top super and one frame will produce three

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:58.640
or four pounds of honey.

00:01:58.640 --> 00:01:59.640
Wow.

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.520
And how long does it take them to do that?

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:09.520
That depends on the honey flow and how many bees you got in the hive, how much honey you're

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:10.520
going to get.

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:17.400
So if you got a full two boxes of honey, bees in the bottom, why you can in a good honey

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:20.440
flow fill one of these honey supers a week.

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:22.560
How many bees would you say are in a hive?

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.800
Is there any way of knowing that?

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:28.200
Approximately 60,000 in August.

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:35.160
They build up during the summer and you end up with 60 to 70,000 in August and early September.

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.000
Do they stay in the same hive?

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.000
Is it like a...

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.000
Yeah.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.520
They all got oriented to this one place.

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:43.520
That's their home base?

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:44.520
Home base.

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:51.200
And they are into the sun and the magnetism of the earth.

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:54.680
If this was cold weather, you wouldn't do this.

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:55.680
And why not?

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:59.160
There'd be too many bees in the hive.

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:06.480
This is a three pound jar of raw Washington honey that my bees make.

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:13.320
We sometimes have fireweed honey or blueberry honey or the blackberry.

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:15.880
You look, you see some pollen in it.

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:23.760
That's why they tell people to buy honey from a local beekeeper if you have allergies.

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:29.360
This is where we get queens out of Hawaii, in a little package like this.

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:30.360
Really?

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:31.360
Yeah.

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:32.920
Now what does a queen cost you?

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:36.440
They're in the neighborhood of $20 this year.

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:39.680
They're going sky high.

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:44.280
I just shipped six of these jars to Anaheim, California.

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:47.280
People from down there like the local honey.

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:49.160
You get it down there.

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:50.680
I mail it to them.

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:53.080
They mail me the check and the freight.

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:56.160
Oh, these are doing real well.

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:20.720
They're clean across the top of the box.
