1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
I totally jacked up his bum.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Good morning, happy Saturday.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
I do not look my best right now.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
I think I feel a little bit better.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Or I'm just on so many drugs that it doesn't hurt.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
And I'm gonna give Bentley a bath and a trim

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
because I don't like the way that he came out

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
when I took him to the groomer.

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Last week I feel like she just scissored him

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
and I don't like it.

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
So I'm gonna do this ish myself.

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
So I'm gonna give him a bath, blow him out.

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I ordered the Wahl Brevara Clipper Set

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
and that should be delivered any minute now by FedEx.

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
So I figure I would just wash and blow him out

16
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
even though he's already kind of clean.

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
But everything I read about using clippers and clipping dogs

18
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
the clippers just work best when they are clean.

19
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Not they're clean, when the dog's clean.

20
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
So I figure I'll just get this part out of the way.

21
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Not gonna use a white shampoo

22
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
because I believe they used one on him at the groomers.

23
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I'm gonna use this Earth Bath Puppy Shampoo

24
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
for blueberry facial for his face.

25
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
And I'm gonna use the Thick and Thicker

26
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
and the After You Base

27
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,000
because I enjoy the results that I get with that.

28
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I think I'm just gonna, unless I completely fail at this mission

29
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I'm just gonna groom him myself because

30
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
clippers were expensive.

31
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
And I'm just wearing the apron because it makes me feel like

32
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
you know, legit.

33
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
People that wear aprons, they know what they're doing.

34
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Ready, Bubbles?

35
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I'm gonna fill up the sink.

36
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Fill it up, fill it up.

37
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Whoops, look at my fluffy fluff flufferson.

38
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
He has like a little fro.

39
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
And he's all clean and dry.

40
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I'm actually quite pleased with my work.

41
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Uh-uh, hunty, uh-uh.

42
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
And I think I kinda desensitized him to the hair dryer

43
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
in his face

44
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
because I just rapid-fired kibble at him

45
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
when I was using the blow dryer and the parts that he didn't like

46
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
because I read in a dog training book

47
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
how to desensitize him and I think it worked a little bit.

48
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I was able to actually blow out his head

49
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
and it's not all wavy.

50
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I mean, I could've blew him out better but you know what?

51
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I think I actually did a pretty good job.

52
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Even though your face is a little dirty.

53
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
So now I'm just gonna let him play

54
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
and we're waiting for our clippers to be delivered.

55
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
You're not gonna go to the groomer no more,

56
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
your mama's gonna do it.

57
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Say, my mama's gonna keep me looking fly, yeah.

58
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
We are like in the catacombs of Atlantic Station.

59
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
And we're gonna get so lost.

60
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Because this parking garage is like so big

61
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:18,000
and we already messed it up like once.

62
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Rich people parking.

63
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
This elevator smells like pee.

64
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
There's the concierge.

65
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Oh, she said the concierge.

66
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Let's just hurry.

67
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Yeah.

68
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
We're two minutes late

69
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,000
but we're gonna try because we don't give up.

70
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
And if it doesn't work, let's just go shopping.

71
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Heck yeah.

72
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Because, well, we're already here.

73
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Ooh, I want some of that good good.

74
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Some of that crawfish bake.

75
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I feel like this is a place you go when you have your life together.

76
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I know, I feel the same.

77
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
You have like a family, you understand how parking works.

78
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
You have like an actual credit card or not.

79
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Ooh, the exhibition center.

80
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I think we have to take the escalator.

81
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I remember she said something about another escalator.

82
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I couldn't work here because I wouldn't be able to help people get anywhere.

83
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Magic.

84
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Magic.

85
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
What's happening, my boy?

86
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Did you get a haircut?

87
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
We need to fix that.

88
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:36,000
And they came.

89
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I totally jacked up his bum.

90
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Bum hole.

91
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
But I'm just gonna leave it.

92
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I'm not gonna try to fix it because then it'll just look stupid.

93
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,000
But that's okay because then it's easier to clean when there's less hair back there.

94
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Do you like your haircut?

95
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:02,000
So I just need to go back in here and just scissor a little bit.

96
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
And he'll be done.

97
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
It's not perfect.

98
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
When you do something the first time, it's never perfect.

99
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Look at all that hair.

100
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,000
He's getting really wiggly and I'm not feeling good.

101
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I think it's time for me to take some more drugs.

102
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:20,000
So we're gonna take a little break and we will resume.

103
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
It's really not that bad.

104
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Probably needs a little more here.

105
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Say, I look good, mama.

106
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
You did a good job.

107
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Oh my god, I like totally jacked up his butt hole.

108
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Do you like it, Barbies?

109
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Do you like your haircut?

110
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
So we are done.

111
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
This is the pile of hair.

112
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
And I'm just gonna, I don't even know what I did.

113
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I just kinda went along with Malti's obsession with what she did in her video.

114
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
He has a couple spots that aren't perfect.

115
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
But it's my first time.

116
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
It's okay.

117
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
And also, he just got blown out.

118
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:07,000
So when his hair grows back and his natural oils come back, it'll blend a lot better.

119
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
You look so cute.

120
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
You're my little puppy forever and ever.

121
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I do wanna do, I want his legs a little smaller.

122
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
And I kinda don't make fun of me, like his butt.

123
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I did way too much.

124
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Show them your butt.

125
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
I did too much on your butt.

126
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I'm sorry, my Barbies.

127
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I'm sorry.

128
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I'm gonna call it a night.

129
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I need to get my life back.

130
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I have stuff everywhere.

131
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I love this.

132
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I am never taking him to the groomer again.

133
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Unless I just need his lines touched up.

134
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,000
What I did, I kinda followed the shape he had.

135
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
And just kinda clipped out.

136
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
She didn't cut him short enough last time.

137
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I like him like that.

138
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
And I want his head to grow out.

139
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
And I don't know.

140
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I have a plan, but I'm just too tired to talk about it.

141
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
So I'm gonna say bye.

142
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Barbies, say goodnight to all your friends.

143
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Bye guys.

144
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
She was crazy.

145
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I got a bath, a blow dry, and a haircut.

146
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
And a top sprout.

147
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,000
She has a knot, but I don't have a full knot yet.

148
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Cause I'm still a baby puppy.

149
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Can you give him the kisses, my Barbies?

150
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Oh, you're such a sweet Barbie.
