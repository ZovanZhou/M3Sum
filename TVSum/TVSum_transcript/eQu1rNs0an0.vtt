00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.240
What's the number one question people ask about fixed gear bikes?

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:24.880
How do you stop?

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:29.240
How to stop on a fixed gear bike is the most frequently asked question from moms, pedestrians,

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:32.920
or other people who can't believe you're riding a bike with no brakes.

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:35.380
There are lots of techniques to stop a fixed gear bike.

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:39.920
The one we recommend is by using your front brake.

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:43.480
But if you're going to be a real G and you got rid of the front brake, here's some tips

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:45.960
that will help you slow your roll.

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.800
First, the skip stop.

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:53.200
This is a technique where you skip on your rear wheel, gradually slowing you down.

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:56.160
When you land, the bike skips and reduces speed.

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.600
Put a few of these together and you just save yourself from crashing into that parked car.

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.400
Hey, what's up guys?

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:06.200
I'm New York and if you're wondering how to do a skip stop, I got your answer.

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.640
First of all, you want to get up to speed.

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.080
You then want to rise out of your saddle, which will take weight off the back wheel.

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:14.880
Then using your feet, you're literally going to pick up the back wheel, which will basically

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.080
stop it in midair.

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.880
Also, keep in mind, whichever foot is forward is the action which you pull up with and whichever

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:21.920
foot is back is the one you push down with.

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:27.880
Basically, those are all the steps to do a skip stop.

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:32.480
A skid stop is where you lock up your rear wheel, causing your bike to skid and slow

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:33.480
down.

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:38.920
This is a fast way to stop, but it also eats up your rear tire.

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:41.980
In order to skid, you need to be going somewhat fast.

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:44.680
Rise out of your saddle to take weight off the back wheel.

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:47.360
Pull up with your left pedal by pushing down with the right pedal, keeping in mind that

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:49.880
your pedal should be horizontal.

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:52.640
If you need extra leverage, you can always push your leg against the top tube of the

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:53.640
frame.

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:59.480
And that's pretty much how you do a skid.

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:03.440
The easiest way to slow down is to apply back pressure to your pedals.

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:07.600
It really looks like nothing, but pull back on the pedals as they rotate and you'll slowly

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:10.320
cruise to a stop.

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:13.320
When riding fixed gear, it is very important to have some kind of foot retention on your

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:14.360
pedals.

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:16.400
You can either use straps or clips.

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:20.920
Either way, you need some kind of foot retention to perform any of the stops we've shown today.

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:24.920
