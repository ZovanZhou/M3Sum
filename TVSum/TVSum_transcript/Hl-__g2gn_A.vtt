00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.680
Hello, I'm Chef Dianne DeMayo and welcome to my kitchen.

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:07.440
Today we are making something super delicious as always.

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:09.920
We are making a Reuben sandwich with what?

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:15.600
Homemade corned beef, sauerkraut, and you can see the recipe on one of my bootleg tip videos.

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:20.960
We have some homemade pickles, again another wonderful bootleg tip video you can catch.

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:25.680
Swiss cheese, rye bread, we're making a very quick, easy Russian dressing.

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.600
And you wonder why I have a side of mustard here?

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:33.520
Because I have to take little tiny bites of the corned beef in between talking.

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:40.080
Okay, so let's build this sandwich.

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:43.680
First I'm going to get out rye bread.

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.120
Now you can use any type of bread you want.

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.240
You don't have to use rye bread.

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:47.520
You don't have to use dark rye bread.

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.200
I'm going to say this really quick because I can do it that way.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.960
Get it on your plate.

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:52.560
Next we're going to start building.

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:54.560
I like fat so the fat stays on.

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:59.440
Layer one, layer two, there we go.

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:01.440
Bam.

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:08.640
Next I'm going to put another layer here of some queso cheese, Swiss.

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.640
Smash it.

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.640
On top of that, some bootleg sauerkraut.

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.640
Smash it.

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:22.640
And a quick and easy do-it-yourself Russian dressing.

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:24.640
But we're going to do the Russian dressing on the side.

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:26.640
Why?

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.640
Because I said so.

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:30.640
And I like to dip it in.

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:32.640
And sometimes I like to alternate with mustard because I am like that.

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.640
So all that really is is just some ketchup and mayonnaise.

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:36.640
You can do it the other way.

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:38.640
And then I'm going to put a little bit of the Russian dressing on the side.

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.640
And then I'm going to put a little bit of the Russian dressing on the side.

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:42.640
And then I'm going to put a little bit of the Russian dressing on the side.

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:44.640
And all that really is is just some ketchup and mayonnaise.

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.640
You can add some oregano, some garlic salt, some onion, some capers.

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:48.640
Whatever you want.

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:50.640
I like to keep it simple.

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.640
Ketchup and mayonnaise.

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:54.640
Kind of like a thousand island dressing.

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:56.640
And we'll leave that there.

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.640
And here's the key to making this something super yum yum.

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:00.640
I'm going to slather one side with butter.

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:02.640
And I'm going to layer it on top of the other.

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.640
And then I'm going to add a little bit of the Russian dressing on the other side.

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:06.640
And I'm going to layer it on top of the other.

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:08.640
And then I'm going to layer it on top of the other.

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.640
And I'm going to layer it on top of the other.

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:12.640
And then we're going to take it to the stove.

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:14.640
And then we're going to take it to the stove.

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.640
Going to get it hot on one side.

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:18.640
Flip that bad boy over.

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:20.640
Put a little butter on the other side.

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.640
And booyah!

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:24.640
It's going to be a hot, crispy, buttery, delicious Reuben sandwich.

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:26.640
It's going to be a hot, crispy, buttery, delicious Reuben sandwich.

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.640
Let's go to the stove.

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:30.640
Okay, my pan is nice and hot.

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:32.640
I've got my buttery side.

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.640
I'm going to do a quick and easy turn.

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:36.640
And while that's doing that,

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:38.640
I'm going to sneak up on its back end.

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.640
I'm going to sneak up on its back end.

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:42.640
And get some butter all over that.

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:44.640
Give it some pressing.

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:46.640
Alright, let's flip him over.

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:48.640
Alright, let's flip him over.

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:50.640
Oh yeah!

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:52.640
Oh yeah!

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:54.640
Look at that!

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:56.640
Reuben sandwich out of the pan,

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:58.640
onto my plate.

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:00.640
Nice, crispy, buttery crust.

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:02.640
Nice, crispy, buttery crust.

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:04.640
Got my knife.

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:06.640
We're going to cut this in half.

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:08.640
We're going to cut this in half.

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:10.640
Now, it's time to taste.

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:12.640
Now, it's time to taste.

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:14.640
But I almost forgot,

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:16.640
you've got to have a little pickle.

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:18.640
Just a little bit.

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:20.640
Oh, how much I love you.

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:22.640
Oh, how much I love you.

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:24.640
You are my friend.

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:26.640
Okay, so a little bit of this.

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:28.640
And there's a system to this.

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:30.640
One bite, ready?

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:40.640
One bite, ready?

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:42.640
Booyah! That was a touchdown.

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:44.640
Corned beef sandwich, homemade.

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:46.640
Bootleg style sauerkraut.

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:48.640
Bootleg style sauerkraut.

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:50.640
Bootleg style pickle with a little bit of russian dressing.

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:52.640
Swiss cheese, rye bread, butter.

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:54.640
Best sandwich ever.

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:56.640
And I will see you next week with another delicious dish.

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:58.640
