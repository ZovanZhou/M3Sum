It's the granddaddy of bike tricks. Either you can do it or you can't. Today

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:10.080
we're gonna teach you how to wheelie.

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:31.480
Hey guys, doing a wheelie is something we've all desired to do since our very

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:35.600
first bike ride. It's all about balance. Once you get it, you can ride the wheelie

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:39.680
for miles. My buddy Cole is gonna show us how it's done. Go ahead and do it man.

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:44.800
First, get comfortable pulling your front wheel up. Then push with your lead

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:49.240
foot and lean back. Practice this riding around an empty parking lot, but don't

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:52.520
use your straps just in case you have to bail. Now once you're able to get the

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:56.520
front wheel up, you need to find a balance point. So try maybe going to a

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.120
wall and holding on and finding that balance point until you get comfortable.

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.840
Let's put it all together. Ride forward and pull the front wheel up. Once you

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:08.880
push off your lead foot, lean back and find your balance point. Once you are

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.680
locked in, remember it's a combination of shifting your body weight and the speed

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:25.280
that you are pedaling. Thank You George. I'll have to practice that as soon as

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:29.640
I'm done here. As always, hit us up on our Twitter if you want to talk or drop a

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:46.120
comment below. Until next time, we'll see you in the streets.
