00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,240
What's the number one question people ask about fixed gear bikes?

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:24,880
How do you stop?

3
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:29,240
How to stop on a fixed gear bike is the most frequently asked question from moms, pedestrians,

4
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:32,920
or other people who can't believe you're riding a bike with no brakes.

5
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:35,380
There are lots of techniques to stop a fixed gear bike.

6
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:39,920
The one we recommend is by using your front brake.

7
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:43,480
But if you're going to be a real G and you got rid of the front brake, here's some tips

8
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:45,960
that will help you slow your roll.

9
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:48,800
First, the skip stop.

10
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:53,200
This is a technique where you skip on your rear wheel, gradually slowing you down.

11
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:56,160
When you land, the bike skips and reduces speed.

12
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:00,600
Put a few of these together and you just save yourself from crashing into that parked car.

13
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,400
Hey, what's up guys?

14
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:06,200
I'm New York and if you're wondering how to do a skip stop, I got your answer.

15
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:08,640
First of all, you want to get up to speed.

16
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:12,080
You then want to rise out of your saddle, which will take weight off the back wheel.

17
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:14,880
Then using your feet, you're literally going to pick up the back wheel, which will basically

18
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,080
stop it in midair.

19
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:19,880
Also, keep in mind, whichever foot is forward is the action which you pull up with and whichever

20
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:21,920
foot is back is the one you push down with.

21
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:27,880
Basically, those are all the steps to do a skip stop.

22
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:32,480
A skid stop is where you lock up your rear wheel, causing your bike to skid and slow

23
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:33,480
down.

24
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:38,920
This is a fast way to stop, but it also eats up your rear tire.

25
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:41,980
In order to skid, you need to be going somewhat fast.

26
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:44,680
Rise out of your saddle to take weight off the back wheel.

27
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:47,360
Pull up with your left pedal by pushing down with the right pedal, keeping in mind that

28
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,880
your pedal should be horizontal.

29
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:52,640
If you need extra leverage, you can always push your leg against the top tube of the

30
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,640
frame.

31
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:59,480
And that's pretty much how you do a skid.

32
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:03,440
The easiest way to slow down is to apply back pressure to your pedals.

33
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:07,600
It really looks like nothing, but pull back on the pedals as they rotate and you'll slowly

34
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:10,320
cruise to a stop.

35
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:13,320
When riding fixed gear, it is very important to have some kind of foot retention on your

36
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:14,360
pedals.

37
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:16,400
You can either use straps or clips.

38
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:20,920
Either way, you need some kind of foot retention to perform any of the stops we've shown today.

39
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:24,920
