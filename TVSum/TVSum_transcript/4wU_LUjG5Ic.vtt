00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Bike Friendly Cities is a European project that wants to get cities cycling.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.560
Southend-on-Sea in Cambridge in the UK, Middelburg and the province of Zeeland in the Netherlands,

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:18.880
Boulogne in France and Kortrijk in Belgium are all working together to promote cycling

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:20.200
in their cities.

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:25.780
In summer 2013, these cities held bike parades and invited everyone to come along, dress

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:32.600
up and celebrate cycling.

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:36.360
My name's Steve and this is Chris and we're on Southend Cycle Ride.

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:42.320
We like cycling because it's out in the fresh air, you make lots of new friends and have

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:43.320
a really good time.

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:44.320
It's good for the environment as well.

00:00:44.320 --> 00:01:02.740
It's nice to get out on the bike and meet other people.

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:04.740
Do you cycle to work?

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:05.740
Yes, daily.

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:06.740
Daily?

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:07.740
Every day you go to work on your bicycles?

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:14.740
Yes.

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:15.740
Hi, I'm Kritika.

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:21.740
I love cycling because it's fun, it keeps me fit, it's cheap and it keeps my carbon

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:22.740
footprint down.

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:35.740
I'm Fran and I like cycling because it's cheap, I get there fast and I get a cheap

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:37.740
ride.

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:42.740
I really have a race bicycle.

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:47.740
Some do it on the professional side, others do it for leisure.

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:53.740
For me it's also a matter of moving and taking out the stress.

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:56.740
The whole week is a lot of stress.

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:04.740
When the weather is a bit fine, like today, I can do some cycling.

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.740
I live in Kortrijk in Belgium.

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:12.740
The bike is the best way to find our way in the city.

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:39.740
It inspires me as well.

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:43.740
Bye.

00:02:43.740 --> 00:03:12.740
Bye.
