00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,160
As Extension educators, we get frequent phone calls concerning paper wasps and their nests.

2
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:16,560
And as a home gardener, you'll probably run into these things at one point in time.

3
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:22,360
Now, this is a little bit of a problem because paper wasps are actually a beneficial insect.

4
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:26,680
They're out collecting caterpillars off of your crops.

5
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:32,520
But the problem is, when you get too close to them, they're indiscriminate stingers.

6
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:37,000
Your spring cleaning and getting ready for gardening, it's a good opportunity to take

7
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,520
those and just remove them from where they're at.

8
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:45,640
And usually they're found in the eaves of homes and structures, and they can be knocked

9
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:51,680
down with a shovel or other implement, and then taken away and thrown away.

10
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:57,520
So if the wasps have built a nest in a location that could potentially be a threat to yourself

11
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:02,160
or your family or your pets, it's a good idea to go ahead and remove it whenever you possibly

12
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:03,220
can.

13
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:05,000
And that can be done chemically.

14
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,720
There are products available that are specific to wasp and hornet control.

15
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:15,920
And wait until evening, spray that product so that all the wasps are on the nest.

16
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:19,640
And then once they've all died, you can clean that wasp nest off just like you would this

17
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:22,580
one that's in the eave that we have already removed.

18
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:38,200
