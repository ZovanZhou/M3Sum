00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Buenos Aires is a city for the fashion conscious.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Everybody wants to look good.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
But dressing up isn't just for porteÃ±os.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Being out on the town presentable is just as important for the dogs.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
But if you are a dog, where do you go for your beauty treatments?

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:31.000
At Sebastians in Recoleta, dogs big and small come in for a model makeover.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
There are hundreds of dog beauty parlors in the city.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Here at Sebastians, the man to see is Hugo.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:22.000
There is no service that he won't do.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.000
Hugo grooms and styles around 25 dogs a day.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:02:02.000
But some customers need more convincing than others.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:16.000
Down here, everyone knows who the boss is.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.000
But when he comes here, he calms down and stays in Hugo's hands.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.000
He is the only one who knows how to groom and cut.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.000
Sprucing up isn't always the most pleasant experience.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
But when you look good, you feel good.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:03:03.000
There are dogs that come to the door, go and jump on the doorstep, alone.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
They come to a comfortable place, where they can meet other animals.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.000
They live happily here.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.000
Bye, Cecilia.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:22.000
Bye, Hugo.
