1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,440
There's a slogan that reads,

2
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:11,480
charging an electric car is charging the energy

3
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:12,700
of the earth.

4
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:14,400
This means that you get to play a role

5
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,740
in reducing greenhouse gas emissions

6
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:18,900
by driving eco-friendly vehicles.

7
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:21,840
An exhibition took place to showcase a wide range

8
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:24,380
of electric cars and related equipment.

9
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:27,000
Let's take a look.

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,500
This is an electric car that emits less carbon dioxide

11
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:32,000
and air pollutants.

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,900
If you connect this car with a charger,

13
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:37,500
it provides electric current through a transmission.

14
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:40,400
The Ministry of Environment, Seoul Metropolitan Government

15
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:43,000
and Korea Environment Corporation have jointly

16
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,100
established infrastructure for electric cars.

17
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:51,000
Last year, we established a charging system to feed

18
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
up to 500 electric cars.

19
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,900
We plan to build another one with a capacity

20
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:57,100
of 2,600 vehicles this year.

21
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:59,600
And if this takes place, more electric cars will come

22
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,500
into place, which will lead to carbon emissions reduction

23
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:05,100
and air quality improvement.

24
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:08,300
This is a machine that accesses data of electric voltage

25
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:11,700
and current for efficient use of electric vehicles.

26
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:14,100
As it can estimate the efficiency rate,

27
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:18,000
it's useful when conducting research and development.

28
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,300
The 2012 electric vehicle

29
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:23,400
and smart car exhibition was held on October 17th

30
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,800
to display eco-friendly electric vehicles

31
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:28,300
and related equipment.

32
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:30,900
Manufacturers of electric vehicles,

33
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:33,500
related industries including two-wheeled vehicles,

34
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:34,500
parts and materials,

35
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:37,500
charging systems participated in this exhibition.

36
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,100
This is a business fair that is aimed

37
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:41,800
at facilitating exchanges between professionals

38
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:44,300
in the electric vehicle industry.

39
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:46,900
This fair presented diverse electric vehicles,

40
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:49,300
auto parts and analysis system as well

41
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:52,300
as all electric battery-powered buses.

42
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:54,800
Overseas market seminars were held on the sideline

43
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,600
of the event to give information

44
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:59,900
to Korean electric car manufacturers.

45
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:03,100
Electric vehicles have reduced greenhouse gas emissions

46
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:04,600
and air pollutants.

47
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:07,400
To raise penetration rate of electric cars,

48
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,900
companies will have to endeavor

49
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:22,900
to develop advanced technologies.
