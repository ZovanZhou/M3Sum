00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,600
A deadly killer bee attack that was all caught on tape and you're gonna see it right now on KLD News 13 and only on KLD News 13.

2
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:14,000
Sonu Wasu is in Bisbee tonight with people that witnessed this terrible incident.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:21,200
We are inside an outbuilding on a farm here in Bisbee where this massive killer bee hive was located.

4
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:25,500
Right up there in the ceiling of this building you can see they've cut out a hole up there.

5
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:33,800
Right there was a 200 pound hive big enough we're told to hold more than 250,000 killer bees.

6
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:39,400
It is the attack of the killer bees. Sound like a horror flick? This is very real.

7
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:43,200
An animal farm located off Highway 80 in Bisbee.

8
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:47,700
Freelance videographer Al Signore shot this unbelievable footage.

9
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:50,000
A thousand pound boar under attack.

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
This is the worst one I've seen.

11
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,600
And it got worse when the swarm turned its fury on the farmers.

12
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:59,900
I jumped into my truck and unfortunately the passenger window was partly open.

13
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:06,000
So they came in in a black cloud. Many, many. So I had to swap them out the driver's window.

14
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,400
And it was pretty, pretty bad.

15
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,000
Pretty bad. Did you get stung?

16
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Four or five times.

17
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,900
This hand that did the swatting really looked like I'd been boxing without gloves.

18
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:18,800
When everyone else runs this guy comes buzzing in.

19
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:21,600
Reid Booth calls himself the killer bee guy.

20
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:26,000
I do most of the Africanized bee removal for Sheriff, Police, Fire, Border Patrol.

21
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,300
Booth says the bees seem to be feistier this year.

22
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:31,300
This year is worse than I've seen in 10 years.

23
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:35,500
A thousand pound peg is a huge thing and has skin like that and fat like that on it.

24
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:37,600
So I'm kind of surprised that it did kill it.

25
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:43,100
Even in a bee suit and helmet attacking a hive filled with a quarter million aggressive bees is not easy.

26
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:47,300
And it was extremely hot to get up in there and work because of probably 180 degrees.

27
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:50,100
It was really something else. And I ended up with heat stroke actually.

28
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:52,300
Heat stroke and burning stings.

29
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:55,500
Sadly, the 1,000 pound boar did not survive.

30
00:01:55,500 --> 00:02:01,800
Another pregnant 800 pound sow went into a coma, lost all her babies, and is now recovering.

31
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:05,600
Now experts say if you do happen to see such a hive on your property,

32
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:08,300
do not try to eradicate these bees yourself.

33
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:12,400
It is a very dangerous job that should be left up to professionals.

34
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:16,300
In Bisbee, Sonu Basu, KOLD News 13, live local late breaking.

35
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:17,100
Thank you, Sonu.

36
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:20,100
The Pima Community College's plan to aid...
