00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:22.120
Here we are at Saigon Sandwich.

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:25.120
So this is the tofu sandwich.

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:32.120
It's very nice.

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:37.120
Let me just move it around a bit.

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:38.120
Very nice.

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:39.120
Great.

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.120
Asian Art Museum.

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:41.120
Eating the sandwich.

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:42.120
How is it?

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:43.120
Really good.

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:44.120
Really good eh?

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:45.120
Yeah.

00:00:45.120 --> 00:01:04.120
You are really really close.

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:08.120
This is the mixed combination.

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:11.120
Go away birds.

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:18.120
Birds too close.

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:29.120
It's special.

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:46.120
Oh that's what I do.

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:50.120
So what kind of dessert is this?

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:52.120
It's a Vietnamese bean pudding.

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:53.120
Bean pudding?

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:54.120
It's called Jea.

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:55.120
Nice.

00:01:55.120 --> 00:02:02.120
How is it?

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:09.120
Really good.

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:17.120
Really good?

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:18.120
Authentic eh?

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:19.120
Yep.

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:20.120
So apparently there is rice inside.

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:21.120
Oh yeah.

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:26.120
What is this?

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:29.120
Very interesting.

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:32.120
What is it made out of?

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:38.120
There is rice and it's wrapped inside a banana leaf, stuffed pork and steamed.

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:39.120
Wow.

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:40.120
It's really good.

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:41.120
You can see the inside there.

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:56.120
How is it?

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:04.120
Good.

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:11.120
It's like a version of the evil castle.
