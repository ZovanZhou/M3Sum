1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,000
How did you get started in this?

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:17,840
My daddy was a beekeeper and I kind of followed along with him.

3
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:25,000
And after I got through teaching, why I added a few more hives.

4
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,520
They are undertaker bees, guard bees, nursery bees.

5
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:33,720
They go through all those different stages in the hive.

6
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:40,960
Cans of syrup that we feed the new hives when we start them.

7
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:46,760
And there's one that goes on each hive and the bees are able to get the syrup out of

8
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:51,480
these cans when they're sitting upside down by the cloth here.

9
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:58,240
We can go over here and open up a hive and look and see what the bees are doing.

10
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:04,800
Now you going to get in trouble with those bees by opening up that hive?

11
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:05,800
No.

12
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:10,960
See they're working on a honey super now.

13
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:18,320
They're building new comb here, new comb here on the, this is what we start with and they

14
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:21,680
can see where they're building the new comb.

15
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,880
How come they don't get mad at you?

16
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:29,000
Because I'm handling carefully and I'm gentle and they like my smell.

17
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,400
They know who you are.

18
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,400
Yes.

19
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:34,040
There's a drone bee.

20
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:35,120
Which one is he?

21
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:36,120
This big guy right there?

22
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:37,120
Yeah.

23
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:38,920
How do you know he's a drone bee?

24
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:40,800
Because of the size of him.

25
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:43,440
He's got a rounded butt.

26
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:48,120
And they're filling the honey super from the maples and the early blooming flowers here

27
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:49,120
in Washington.

28
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:56,680
There'd be about 60 pounds of honey in that top super and one frame will produce three

29
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:58,640
or four pounds of honey.

30
00:01:58,640 --> 00:01:59,640
Wow.

31
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:03,520
And how long does it take them to do that?

32
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:09,520
That depends on the honey flow and how many bees you got in the hive, how much honey you're

33
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,520
going to get.

34
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:17,400
So if you got a full two boxes of honey, bees in the bottom, why you can in a good honey

35
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:20,440
flow fill one of these honey supers a week.

36
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,560
How many bees would you say are in a hive?

37
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,800
Is there any way of knowing that?

38
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:28,200
Approximately 60,000 in August.

39
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:35,160
They build up during the summer and you end up with 60 to 70,000 in August and early September.

40
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:37,000
Do they stay in the same hive?

41
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Is it like a...

42
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Yeah.

43
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,520
They all got oriented to this one place.

44
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:43,520
That's their home base?

45
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,520
Home base.

46
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:51,200
And they are into the sun and the magnetism of the earth.

47
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:54,680
If this was cold weather, you wouldn't do this.

48
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:55,680
And why not?

49
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:59,160
There'd be too many bees in the hive.

50
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:06,480
This is a three pound jar of raw Washington honey that my bees make.

51
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:13,320
We sometimes have fireweed honey or blueberry honey or the blackberry.

52
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:15,880
You look, you see some pollen in it.

53
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:23,760
That's why they tell people to buy honey from a local beekeeper if you have allergies.

54
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:29,360
This is where we get queens out of Hawaii, in a little package like this.

55
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,360
Really?

56
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,360
Yeah.

57
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,920
Now what does a queen cost you?

58
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:36,440
They're in the neighborhood of $20 this year.

59
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:39,680
They're going sky high.

60
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:44,280
I just shipped six of these jars to Anaheim, California.

61
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:47,280
People from down there like the local honey.

62
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,160
You get it down there.

63
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,680
I mail it to them.

64
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:53,080
They mail me the check and the freight.

65
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:56,160
Oh, these are doing real well.

66
00:03:56,160 --> 00:04:20,720
They're clean across the top of the box.
