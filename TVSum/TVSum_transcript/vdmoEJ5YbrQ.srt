00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Hello!

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Okay, tell us what happened.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Okay, well, um, second time driving and we were just like driving down the patch.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
She was following the dog.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Yeah, and um, there was a snow drift and this car kind of got stuck in the snow.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
So what were you two young lovers doing in the back 40 acres anyways all alone?

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
They were scootin'!

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Driving, oh, okay.

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I think they were scootin'!

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
He was hoping he was going to run out of gas.

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Yeah.

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
He said he got stuck, so he said he got stuck, it was just as much fun.

13
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
You put too much.

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
You idiot!

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
We're a long way back.

16
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Long, long, long, long way back.

17
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
What's the happy camper?

18
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
What was always happy?

19
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I don't know.

20
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
We just had to walk all the way back?

21
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Well, yeah, there you go, you're in a big drift.

22
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Yeah.

23
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Oh, that's old snow, I don't know if we're going to get out.

24
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
That's old snow from before the melt came.

25
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
That's hard snow, we're probably stuck for good.

26
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Oh boy.

27
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Oh, we'll see what he does.

28
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Yeah, you're, um, I think you're stuck for good.

29
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
This we don't even know, do we?

30
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Well, that's, yeah, it's pretty bad.

31
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
We're eating thorn bushes.

32
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Yep, there's no use digging this one out.

33
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
No, so what are we going to do?

34
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
We'll have to leave it and hope the Indians don't destroy it.

35
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Push, push everybody.

36
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
No, we can't get it out.

37
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Then push the other way.

38
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Push the frame.

39
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Push the other way.

40
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:18,000
We need 50 more kids like you and we might have hope, but the way things are looking,

41
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
just take the key out and we'll have to take the Subaru back.

42
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
You got the key?

43
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
No, it wasn't that simple.

44
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
All right.

45
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Why don't we try?

46
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
It was a hell of an adventure, wasn't it?

47
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Oh, fuck, the check, the check.

48
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Don't even know what to say.

49
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
She never forgot her first day driving, so never forget her second day driving.

50
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Right?

51
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Yeah.

52
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Right, Wolf?

53
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Wolf will show us the way.

54
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
He found a mouse on me and walked back.

55
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Did he eat it?

56
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Almost did.

57
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Got in his mouth and I think it bit him or something.

58
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Yeah, a little bite.

59
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:16,000
No, there are things that go along the edge of the front window, but they made it look more racy.

60
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Okay, all aboard.

61
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Hey, can we go home and do the cornfield?

62
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Yeah.

63
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Hey, I made the front.

64
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Let's go.

65
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Not anymore.

66
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I think it's funny how Wolf is...

67
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Can I sit there?

68
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Michael, we're driving back through the cornfield.

69
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I'm not sure.

70
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Hey, everybody.

71
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Good, I get to back with my brothers.

72
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Oh, cool.

73
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:55,000
All right.

74
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Here comes the cornfield.

75
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Here, you can film.

76
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Catherine.

77
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Yeah.

78
00:04:44,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Is there snow coming in back there?

79
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
That's fun.

80
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:14,000
See, when you get to be a good driver, you can do this all you want, then you come out.

81
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Hey, J.K., did the hills give you butterflies?

82
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
The hills don't give me butterflies out here.

83
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
J.K., seriously, did the hills give you butterflies?

84
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
No, they give me bumblebees.

85
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Who wants to go on Sky Hill?

86
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Yeah.

87
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Yeah.

88
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Yeah.
