WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
Okay.

00:02.000 --> 00:04.000
Is it on?

00:04.000 --> 00:06.000
Yeah.

00:06.000 --> 00:08.000
So what are we doing, Kate?

00:08.000 --> 00:12.000
We are on our way to go watch the sun set.

00:12.000 --> 00:14.000
We're gonna meet up with Rebecca.

00:14.000 --> 00:16.000
Yeah.

00:16.000 --> 00:18.000
So it's gonna be like a...

00:18.000 --> 00:20.000
We're gonna get coffee by the end.

00:20.000 --> 00:22.000
We're running late.

00:22.000 --> 00:24.000
You know, this happens.

00:24.000 --> 00:26.000
Hey Sean, what are you doing over there?

00:26.000 --> 00:29.000
I'm trying to get us to see the sunset.

00:29.000 --> 00:31.000
That is quite pathetic.

00:31.000 --> 00:33.000
Are you taking the long route there?

00:33.000 --> 00:35.000
I can't say that to him.

00:35.000 --> 00:37.000
But that was my fault.

00:37.000 --> 00:40.000
I got a phone call. I have a Cadillac CTS.

00:40.000 --> 00:42.000
A really nice one.

00:42.000 --> 00:45.000
My wife went out with two of her friends.

00:45.000 --> 00:47.000
They get talking.

00:47.000 --> 00:49.000
Yeah.

00:49.000 --> 00:51.000
$2,000 worth of damage.

00:51.000 --> 00:53.000
The two tires on the driver's side.

00:53.000 --> 00:55.000
You hit a curb.

00:55.000 --> 00:57.000
The rims of the tires.

00:57.000 --> 00:59.000
That's the...

00:59.000 --> 01:01.000
I know. What are the...

01:01.000 --> 01:03.000
Yeah.

01:03.000 --> 01:05.000
Well, luckily this one's not worth a lot.

01:05.000 --> 01:07.000
What did you say?

01:07.000 --> 01:09.000
I said, luckily your car's not worth a lot.

01:09.000 --> 01:11.000
Let's go look at it.

01:11.000 --> 01:13.000
No.

01:13.000 --> 01:15.000
My other one I brought.

01:15.000 --> 01:19.000
And he was like, oh gee, it needs a battery.

01:19.000 --> 01:21.000
I'll send you the money. I'll buy a battery.

01:21.000 --> 01:23.000
But, you know,

01:23.000 --> 01:25.000
he didn't have to pay any bills on the damn thing

01:25.000 --> 01:27.000
to get up there.

01:27.000 --> 01:29.000
He just got a new battery.

01:29.000 --> 01:31.000
He complained, oh gee, I can't get up there.

01:31.000 --> 01:33.000
I bought it so he could ski.

01:33.000 --> 01:35.000
I bought it six years old

01:35.000 --> 01:37.000
and he can't go skiing.

01:37.000 --> 01:39.000
The poor young guy.

01:39.000 --> 01:41.000
Look really closely in between the trees.

01:41.000 --> 01:43.000
You can see...

01:43.000 --> 01:45.000
Oh.

01:45.000 --> 01:47.000
I wonder if we can see Rebecca on her way.

01:47.000 --> 01:49.000
How about your flat tire?

01:49.000 --> 01:51.000
We could definitely see that.

01:51.000 --> 01:53.000
Oh, maybe you should have driven.

01:53.000 --> 01:55.000
I wonder what happened.

01:55.000 --> 01:57.000
What do you think?

01:57.000 --> 01:59.000
Now we're waiting for Rebecca to get here with her jack from her car.

01:59.000 --> 02:01.000
So we can change, I can change my tire.

02:01.000 --> 02:03.000
And we're going to have some Cadbury.

02:03.000 --> 02:05.000
Oh, hey, look what I found.

02:05.000 --> 02:07.000
Cadbury Easter eggs

02:07.000 --> 02:09.000
with solid milk chocolate

02:09.000 --> 02:11.000
with a crisp sugar shell.

02:11.000 --> 02:13.000
Should we open them and try them?

02:13.000 --> 02:15.000
Sounds...

02:15.000 --> 02:17.000
I was going to say delicious.

02:17.000 --> 02:19.000
Sounds delightful.

02:19.000 --> 02:21.000
Let's open them and see what they taste like.

02:21.000 --> 02:23.000
Did you like our old friend?

02:23.000 --> 02:25.000
We're friends on Facebook.

02:25.000 --> 02:27.000
Rebecca's calling me.

02:27.000 --> 02:29.000
She probably got a flat tire.

02:29.000 --> 02:31.000
Hello?

02:31.000 --> 02:33.000
We're at the

02:33.000 --> 02:35.000
San Remo condo.

02:35.000 --> 02:37.000
Oh, there's Rebecca.

02:37.000 --> 02:39.000
She's pulling over here.

02:39.000 --> 02:41.000
She can't see.

02:41.000 --> 02:43.000
Maybe I should buy that car.

02:43.000 --> 02:45.000
Oh, no, there's rust.

02:45.000 --> 02:47.000
You can see the rust under it.

02:47.000 --> 02:49.000
Oh, here comes Rebecca.

02:49.000 --> 02:51.000
This doesn't look good.

02:57.000 --> 02:59.000
How's it going?

02:59.000 --> 03:01.000
Come on, muscle man.

03:03.000 --> 03:05.000
I don't know how to get in there.

03:09.000 --> 03:11.000
We've been having fun taking videos.

03:13.000 --> 03:15.000
The adventure of karma

03:15.000 --> 03:17.000
and friends.

03:17.000 --> 03:19.000
Maybe it's...

03:19.000 --> 03:21.000
I think it's attached

03:21.000 --> 03:23.000
in there with a

03:23.000 --> 03:25.000
jack tool.

03:25.000 --> 03:27.000
Do I need to move this chest

03:27.000 --> 03:29.000
thing out?

03:29.000 --> 03:31.000
No, your chest is fine.

03:31.000 --> 03:33.000
It'll just be a

03:33.000 --> 03:35.000
distraction, Rebecca.

03:37.000 --> 03:39.000
Oh, my legs burn. My inner thighs.

03:39.000 --> 03:41.000
Did you get it?

03:41.000 --> 03:43.000
Yay!

03:43.000 --> 03:45.000
Freaking duh!

03:45.000 --> 03:47.000
Show us happiness.

03:47.000 --> 03:49.000
Show us happy faces.

03:51.000 --> 03:53.000
Yes, we are.

03:53.000 --> 03:55.000
We got it.

03:57.000 --> 03:59.000
Sean, have you ever done this before?

03:59.000 --> 04:01.000
No.

04:01.000 --> 04:03.000
Do you feel manly?

04:03.000 --> 04:05.000
No.

04:05.000 --> 04:07.000
I'm kind of stupid.

04:07.000 --> 04:09.000
Where'd he come from?

04:09.000 --> 04:11.000
He's from the family.

04:11.000 --> 04:13.000
I'm not sure.

04:15.000 --> 04:17.000
I'm going to eat another piece of chocolate

04:17.000 --> 04:19.000
while they're figuring out what to do.

04:23.000 --> 04:25.000
See a little Cadbury egg.

04:31.000 --> 04:33.000
I stepped in the ant pile.

04:33.000 --> 04:35.000
That's what I get.

04:35.000 --> 04:37.000
The instructions.

04:37.000 --> 04:39.000
They're upside down.

04:43.000 --> 04:45.000
Let's see.

04:47.000 --> 04:49.000
They're over here.

04:49.000 --> 04:51.000
Oh, for cranking?

04:51.000 --> 04:53.000
Oh, we don't have a knob.

04:53.000 --> 04:55.000
Yours is different.

04:55.000 --> 04:57.000
How's it going?

04:57.000 --> 04:59.000
Well, I figured out an alternative way

04:59.000 --> 05:01.000
to spin things around.

05:01.000 --> 05:03.000
Turn things around.

05:03.000 --> 05:05.000
Oh.

05:09.000 --> 05:11.000
So it's an adventure with you,

05:11.000 --> 05:13.000
Shawny.

05:13.000 --> 05:15.000
Shawny.

05:21.000 --> 05:23.000
You can flip tires.

05:23.000 --> 05:25.000
Wahoo!

05:25.000 --> 05:27.000
Heck yeah!

05:27.000 --> 05:29.000
Well done, my friend.

05:29.000 --> 05:31.000
Oh, gosh.

05:31.000 --> 05:33.000
How are we going to recover this bad boy?

05:33.000 --> 05:35.000
Ouchies.

05:35.000 --> 05:37.000
It's from too much dancing in the car.

05:39.000 --> 05:41.000
Do you need Rebecca's help?

05:41.000 --> 05:43.000
No, it's on me.

05:43.000 --> 05:45.000
I feel so bad I can't help, Shawn.

05:47.000 --> 05:49.000
It has to be lined up right.

05:49.000 --> 05:51.000
You're going to get a hernia.

05:51.000 --> 05:53.000
Let Rebecca help you.

05:53.000 --> 05:55.000
Good job!

05:57.000 --> 05:59.000
Oh, jeez.

05:59.000 --> 06:01.000
What I don't like about tires

06:01.000 --> 06:03.000
is that you have to not tighten them

06:03.000 --> 06:05.000
all at once.

06:05.000 --> 06:07.000
At the same time, you have to go one at a time.

06:09.000 --> 06:11.000
Thanks for saving us.

06:11.000 --> 06:13.000
And then I'll tighten it really tight

06:13.000 --> 06:15.000
when I'm on the car.

06:15.000 --> 06:17.000
Rebecca's to the rescue.

06:17.000 --> 06:19.000
I know, aren't you proud?

06:19.000 --> 06:21.000
Ladies, take note.

06:21.000 --> 06:23.000
Shawn can chain a tire.

06:25.000 --> 06:27.000
Go, Shawn.

06:27.000 --> 06:29.000
I see a little bald spot

06:29.000 --> 06:31.000
in the back of your head.

06:31.000 --> 06:33.000
It's a scar.

06:33.000 --> 06:35.000
I was in a bad jump rope accident.

06:39.000 --> 06:41.000
Now, the key to being successful

06:41.000 --> 06:43.000
in life is to always have a spare.

06:43.000 --> 06:45.000
A backup plane, if you will.

06:47.000 --> 06:49.000
So, that's a spider.

06:49.000 --> 06:51.000
Now it's dead.

06:51.000 --> 06:53.000
Did I get them?

06:55.000 --> 06:57.000
Kate's just calling her dad to see if I did it right.

07:05.000 --> 07:07.000
Why is it your life? It's my car.

07:07.000 --> 07:09.000
My battery's gone. Oh my gosh, it's going to die again.

07:17.000 --> 07:19.000
In the air?

07:21.000 --> 07:23.000
Because they need to be tightened more.

07:23.000 --> 07:25.000
Like a lot.

07:25.000 --> 07:27.000
Well, can you ask dad?

07:27.000 --> 07:29.000
Who are you talking to?

07:29.000 --> 07:31.000
We did it!

07:31.000 --> 07:33.000
Who's me? You did it!

07:35.000 --> 07:37.000
Is there anything you would like to say?

07:37.000 --> 07:39.000
I'd like to thank the Academy.

07:39.000 --> 07:41.000
I'd like to thank

07:41.000 --> 07:43.000
being voted Best Director for this short film.

07:45.000 --> 07:47.000
It's a huge inspiration for me.

07:47.000 --> 07:49.000
I didn't think I would get that.

07:49.000 --> 07:51.000
I didn't think I'd be nominated.

07:51.000 --> 07:53.000
Sean, I'm so proud of you.

07:53.000 --> 07:55.000
And, the sun is down.

07:57.000 --> 07:59.000
Victory dance!

07:59.000 --> 08:01.000
The funny thing is,

08:01.000 --> 08:03.000
he's actually a good dancer.

08:23.000 --> 08:25.000
This is Sean trying to win my heart.

08:29.000 --> 08:31.000
I love you.

08:33.000 --> 08:35.000
Jerry, look at Jerry.

08:55.000 --> 08:57.000
He's so concentrated on finding the tip.

08:57.000 --> 08:59.000
Seriously?

08:59.000 --> 09:01.000
Seriously.

09:05.000 --> 09:07.000
Cole's embarrassed.

09:07.000 --> 09:09.000
Rebecca's already done.

09:09.000 --> 09:11.000
I can do it now.

09:13.000 --> 09:15.000
And Sean's still working it out.

09:27.000 --> 09:29.000
I love you.

09:29.000 --> 09:31.000
I love you.

09:31.000 --> 09:33.000
I love you so much.
