1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Okay.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Is it on?

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Yeah.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
So what are we doing, Kate?

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
We are on our way to go watch the sun set.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
We're gonna meet up with Rebecca.

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Yeah.

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
So it's gonna be like a...

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
We're gonna get coffee by the end.

10
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
We're running late.

11
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
You know, this happens.

12
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Hey Sean, what are you doing over there?

13
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
I'm trying to get us to see the sunset.

14
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
That is quite pathetic.

15
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Are you taking the long route there?

16
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I can't say that to him.

17
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
But that was my fault.

18
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I got a phone call. I have a Cadillac CTS.

19
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
A really nice one.

20
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
My wife went out with two of her friends.

21
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
They get talking.

22
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Yeah.

23
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
$2,000 worth of damage.

24
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
The two tires on the driver's side.

25
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
You hit a curb.

26
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
The rims of the tires.

27
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
That's the...

28
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I know. What are the...

29
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Yeah.

30
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Well, luckily this one's not worth a lot.

31
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
What did you say?

32
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I said, luckily your car's not worth a lot.

33
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Let's go look at it.

34
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
No.

35
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
My other one I brought.

36
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
And he was like, oh gee, it needs a battery.

37
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I'll send you the money. I'll buy a battery.

38
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
But, you know,

39
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
he didn't have to pay any bills on the damn thing

40
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
to get up there.

41
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
He just got a new battery.

42
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
He complained, oh gee, I can't get up there.

43
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I bought it so he could ski.

44
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I bought it six years old

45
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
and he can't go skiing.

46
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
The poor young guy.

47
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Look really closely in between the trees.

48
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
You can see...

49
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Oh.

50
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I wonder if we can see Rebecca on her way.

51
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
How about your flat tire?

52
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
We could definitely see that.

53
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Oh, maybe you should have driven.

54
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I wonder what happened.

55
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
What do you think?

56
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Now we're waiting for Rebecca to get here with her jack from her car.

57
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
So we can change, I can change my tire.

58
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
And we're going to have some Cadbury.

59
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Oh, hey, look what I found.

60
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Cadbury Easter eggs

61
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
with solid milk chocolate

62
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
with a crisp sugar shell.

63
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Should we open them and try them?

64
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Sounds...

65
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I was going to say delicious.

66
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Sounds delightful.

67
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Let's open them and see what they taste like.

68
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Did you like our old friend?

69
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
We're friends on Facebook.

70
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Rebecca's calling me.

71
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
She probably got a flat tire.

72
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Hello?

73
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
We're at the

74
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
San Remo condo.

75
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Oh, there's Rebecca.

76
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
She's pulling over here.

77
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
She can't see.

78
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Maybe I should buy that car.

79
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Oh, no, there's rust.

80
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
You can see the rust under it.

81
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Oh, here comes Rebecca.

82
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
This doesn't look good.

83
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
How's it going?

84
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Come on, muscle man.

85
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I don't know how to get in there.

86
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
We've been having fun taking videos.

87
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
The adventure of karma

88
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
and friends.

89
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Maybe it's...

90
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I think it's attached

91
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
in there with a

92
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
jack tool.

93
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Do I need to move this chest

94
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
thing out?

95
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
No, your chest is fine.

96
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
It'll just be a

97
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
distraction, Rebecca.

98
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Oh, my legs burn. My inner thighs.

99
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Did you get it?

100
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Yay!

101
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Freaking duh!

102
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Show us happiness.

103
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Show us happy faces.

104
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Yes, we are.

105
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
We got it.

106
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Sean, have you ever done this before?

107
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
No.

108
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Do you feel manly?

109
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
No.

110
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I'm kind of stupid.

111
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Where'd he come from?

112
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
He's from the family.

113
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I'm not sure.

114
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I'm going to eat another piece of chocolate

115
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
while they're figuring out what to do.

116
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
See a little Cadbury egg.

117
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I stepped in the ant pile.

118
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
That's what I get.

119
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
The instructions.

120
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
They're upside down.

121
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Let's see.

122
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
They're over here.

123
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Oh, for cranking?

124
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Oh, we don't have a knob.

125
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Yours is different.

126
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
How's it going?

127
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Well, I figured out an alternative way

128
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
to spin things around.

129
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Turn things around.

130
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Oh.

131
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
So it's an adventure with you,

132
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Shawny.

133
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Shawny.

134
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
You can flip tires.

135
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Wahoo!

136
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Heck yeah!

137
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Well done, my friend.

138
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Oh, gosh.

139
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
How are we going to recover this bad boy?

140
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Ouchies.

141
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
It's from too much dancing in the car.

142
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Do you need Rebecca's help?

143
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
No, it's on me.

144
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I feel so bad I can't help, Shawn.

145
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
It has to be lined up right.

146
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
You're going to get a hernia.

147
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Let Rebecca help you.

148
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Good job!

149
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Oh, jeez.

150
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
What I don't like about tires

151
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
is that you have to not tighten them

152
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
all at once.

153
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
At the same time, you have to go one at a time.

154
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Thanks for saving us.

155
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
And then I'll tighten it really tight

156
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
when I'm on the car.

157
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Rebecca's to the rescue.

158
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I know, aren't you proud?

159
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Ladies, take note.

160
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Shawn can chain a tire.

161
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Go, Shawn.

162
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I see a little bald spot

163
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
in the back of your head.

164
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
It's a scar.

165
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I was in a bad jump rope accident.

166
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Now, the key to being successful

167
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
in life is to always have a spare.

168
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
A backup plane, if you will.

169
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
So, that's a spider.

170
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Now it's dead.

171
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Did I get them?

172
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Kate's just calling her dad to see if I did it right.

173
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Why is it your life? It's my car.

174
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
My battery's gone. Oh my gosh, it's going to die again.

175
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
In the air?

176
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Because they need to be tightened more.

177
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Like a lot.

178
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Well, can you ask dad?

179
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Who are you talking to?

180
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
We did it!

181
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Who's me? You did it!

182
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Is there anything you would like to say?

183
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
I'd like to thank the Academy.

184
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I'd like to thank

185
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
being voted Best Director for this short film.

186
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
It's a huge inspiration for me.

187
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I didn't think I would get that.

188
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
I didn't think I'd be nominated.

189
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Sean, I'm so proud of you.

190
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
And, the sun is down.

191
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Victory dance!

192
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
The funny thing is,

193
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
he's actually a good dancer.

194
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
This is Sean trying to win my heart.

195
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I love you.

196
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Jerry, look at Jerry.

197
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
He's so concentrated on finding the tip.

198
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Seriously?

199
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Seriously.

200
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Cole's embarrassed.

201
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Rebecca's already done.

202
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I can do it now.

203
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
And Sean's still working it out.

204
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
I love you.

205
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I love you.

206
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I love you so much.
