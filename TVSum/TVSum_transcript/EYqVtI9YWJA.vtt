00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.760
Hey, Rex here with 2 Wheel Oklahoma here in Dallas.

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:13.240
I ran into Felipe Smage.

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:14.320
The Spanish trials rider.

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:15.400
That's right.

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:17.600
You may have seen these guys on America's Got Talent.

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:20.280
How long have you guys been riding?

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:25.640
We've been riding since we were around 10 or 11, so about 13 or 14 years.

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:26.640
Wow, okay.

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.360
We've been going to town for quite a while now, but to ride trials it takes that long

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:32.360
to even ride the bike.

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:33.360
Exactly.

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.880
It takes a long time, but once you get to that level it's one of the most fun sports

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:38.400
you can do.

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:39.400
It is a lot of fun.

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:40.400
It's great exercise too.

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:42.400
I understand you guys compete, right?

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:44.480
Yeah, actually I try to compete.

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:46.280
My brother, he competes very well.

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:48.880
He's the four time national champion.

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:49.880
I hold my own.

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:53.200
I ride pro class very long with him, but usually he's at the front of the pack.

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:54.920
I'm just trying to beat a couple guys.

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:55.920
Right.

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.400
I'm just trying to get in there, though, both competing.

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:58.400
What's been the reaction?

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:04.080
I bet all the guys, like Sherco and Gas Gas, the guys that make trials bikes probably just

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.160
think you're the greatest thing to come along.

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:10.160
Have you increased awareness of the sport?

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:12.920
That was actually not only increased awareness of the sport, because that was one thing that

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:14.600
we really shoot for.

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:15.600
We love the sport.

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:16.600
We love to spread it.

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:20.080
That's kind of why we travel around doing demos, to bring the sport to new people.

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:22.800
There's no better medium than national live television.

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:27.960
Not only were we able to bring and grow what we're doing in our shows and our name, but

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.920
also the sport of trials, and then even motorcycling as a whole, because it's got a very negative

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.560
aspect by a lot of the world.

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:38.200
They think of motorcycles, they think of pollution, they think of death, they think of injury.

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:42.200
What we did, we were able to bring it into a tight, confined area, indoor, in a building,

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:43.920
in downtown LA.

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.260
By jumping these barriers, we were able to open some eyes and make people realize that

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.520
maybe the motorcycles aren't such a bad thing.

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:51.880
That was a really big thing that we brought from the show.

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:55.560
It was a really cool experience, and to be able to open up people's eyes in that aspect

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:56.560
was really awesome.

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:59.320
And you scored a gig at the International Motorcycle Show.

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:01.320
And we're here after it, so it was all good for sure.

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.320
So you're going to go around all 12 of them, right?

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:04.320
Yep, yep.

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:05.320
That's great.

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:06.320
We got one down two weeks ago in San Mateo.

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:07.320
We're here in Dallas, Texas.

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:08.320
It was a while getting here.

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:09.320
We had some transmission issues, tire blowouts.

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:10.320
Oh, really?

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:14.960
I mean, still haven't slept since we left to leave here two days ago.

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:15.960
Oh, really?

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:16.960
We're running on thin right now.

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:18.960
It seems like you're really a rock star.

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:19.960
Yeah.

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:21.960
So this is what that feels like.

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:22.960
Oh, cool.

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:23.960
In that case, wow.

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:26.960
Well, there's some other things that go along with that, too.

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:27.960
Yeah, so it's been really good.

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:31.560
We're going to do the whole series, and we've really been able to get our name out there,

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:32.560
and we're booking more shows.

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:35.960
And we're doing what we really want to do, which is entertain people on our bikes.

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:40.840
That's what we've been working for years to be able to do, and now that we have that ability

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:43.440
and the option to do it, we're pushing for more.

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:44.880
Doing what you love for a living.

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:45.880
What a great idea.

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:49.520
Well, we're going to go have a seat and watch the show, and I wish you luck, man.

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:50.520
Hey, thanks a lot.

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:51.520
Enjoy the show.

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:52.520
We need somebody to jump over.

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:53.520
This guy in?

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:54.520
Thanks a lot, man.

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:55.520
Nice to meet you.

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:56.520
Thanks.

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:57.520
Thank you for watching.

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:58.520
Come on over to the tent, get some autographs from these guys.

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:59.520
We've got some free posters for you.

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:06.520
You can get some of these awesome GOAT shirts we've got.

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:08.000
Give these guys a high five.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.000
Give them a handshake.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.000
They're tired.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:26.160
Thank you, guys, cheers.

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:32.420
Thank you!
