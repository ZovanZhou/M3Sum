1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Buenos Aires is a city for the fashion conscious.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Everybody wants to look good.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
But dressing up isn't just for porteños.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Being out on the town presentable is just as important for the dogs.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
But if you are a dog, where do you go for your beauty treatments?

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:31,000
At Sebastians in Recoleta, dogs big and small come in for a model makeover.

7
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
There are hundreds of dog beauty parlors in the city.

8
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Here at Sebastians, the man to see is Hugo.

9
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:22,000
There is no service that he won't do.

10
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Hugo grooms and styles around 25 dogs a day.

11
00:01:33,000 --> 00:02:02,000
But some customers need more convincing than others.

12
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Down here, everyone knows who the boss is.

13
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:38,000
But when he comes here, he calms down and stays in Hugo's hands.

14
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,000
He is the only one who knows how to groom and cut.

15
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Sprucing up isn't always the most pleasant experience.

16
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
But when you look good, you feel good.

17
00:02:50,000 --> 00:03:03,000
There are dogs that come to the door, go and jump on the doorstep, alone.

18
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
They come to a comfortable place, where they can meet other animals.

19
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
They live happily here.

20
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Bye, Cecilia.

21
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Bye, Hugo.
