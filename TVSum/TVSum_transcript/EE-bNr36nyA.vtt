00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.160
As Extension educators, we get frequent phone calls concerning paper wasps and their nests.

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:16.560
And as a home gardener, you'll probably run into these things at one point in time.

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:22.360
Now, this is a little bit of a problem because paper wasps are actually a beneficial insect.

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:26.680
They're out collecting caterpillars off of your crops.

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:32.520
But the problem is, when you get too close to them, they're indiscriminate stingers.

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.000
Your spring cleaning and getting ready for gardening, it's a good opportunity to take

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.520
those and just remove them from where they're at.

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:45.640
And usually they're found in the eaves of homes and structures, and they can be knocked

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:51.680
down with a shovel or other implement, and then taken away and thrown away.

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:57.520
So if the wasps have built a nest in a location that could potentially be a threat to yourself

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:02.160
or your family or your pets, it's a good idea to go ahead and remove it whenever you possibly

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.220
can.

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:05.000
And that can be done chemically.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.720
There are products available that are specific to wasp and hornet control.

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:15.920
And wait until evening, spray that product so that all the wasps are on the nest.

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:19.640
And then once they've all died, you can clean that wasp nest off just like you would this

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:22.580
one that's in the eave that we have already removed.

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:38.200
