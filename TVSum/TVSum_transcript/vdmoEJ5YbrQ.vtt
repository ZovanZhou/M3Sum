00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000
Hello!

00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Okay, tell us what happened.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Okay, well, um, second time driving and we were just like driving down the patch.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
She was following the dog.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Yeah, and um, there was a snow drift and this car kind of got stuck in the snow.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
So what were you two young lovers doing in the back 40 acres anyways all alone?

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
They were scootin'!

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Driving, oh, okay.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
I think they were scootin'!

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
He was hoping he was going to run out of gas.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Yeah.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
He said he got stuck, so he said he got stuck, it was just as much fun.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
You put too much.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
You idiot!

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
We're a long way back.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Long, long, long, long way back.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
What's the happy camper?

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
What was always happy?

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
I don't know.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
We just had to walk all the way back?

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Well, yeah, there you go, you're in a big drift.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
Yeah.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
Oh, that's old snow, I don't know if we're going to get out.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
That's old snow from before the melt came.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
That's hard snow, we're probably stuck for good.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
Oh boy.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
Oh, we'll see what he does.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Yeah, you're, um, I think you're stuck for good.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
This we don't even know, do we?

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:50.000
Well, that's, yeah, it's pretty bad.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
We're eating thorn bushes.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
Yep, there's no use digging this one out.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
No, so what are we going to do?

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
We'll have to leave it and hope the Indians don't destroy it.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
Push, push everybody.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
No, we can't get it out.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
Then push the other way.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
Push the frame.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
Push the other way.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.000
We need 50 more kids like you and we might have hope, but the way things are looking,

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
just take the key out and we'll have to take the Subaru back.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
You got the key?

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.000
No, it wasn't that simple.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
All right.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
Why don't we try?

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
It was a hell of an adventure, wasn't it?

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.000
Oh, fuck, the check, the check.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
Don't even know what to say.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000
She never forgot her first day driving, so never forget her second day driving.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.000
Right?

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.000
Yeah.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:49.000
Right, Wolf?

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.000
Wolf will show us the way.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
He found a mouse on me and walked back.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.000
Did he eat it?

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
Almost did.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.000
Got in his mouth and I think it bit him or something.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:09.000
Yeah, a little bite.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:16.000
No, there are things that go along the edge of the front window, but they made it look more racy.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
Okay, all aboard.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
Hey, can we go home and do the cornfield?

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.000
Yeah.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.000
Hey, I made the front.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.000
Let's go.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.000
Not anymore.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
I think it's funny how Wolf is...

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:38.000
Can I sit there?

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
Michael, we're driving back through the cornfield.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000
I'm not sure.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.000
Hey, everybody.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000
Good, I get to back with my brothers.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.000
Oh, cool.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:55.000
All right.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:01.000
Here comes the cornfield.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:11.000
Here, you can film.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:26.000
Catherine.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:44.000
Yeah.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:05:07.000
Is there snow coming in back there?

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:08.000
That's fun.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:14.000
See, when you get to be a good driver, you can do this all you want, then you come out.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
Hey, J.K., did the hills give you butterflies?

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000
The hills don't give me butterflies out here.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000
J.K., seriously, did the hills give you butterflies?

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
No, they give me bumblebees.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
Who wants to go on Sky Hill?

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.000
Yeah.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.000
Yeah.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:39.000
Yeah.
