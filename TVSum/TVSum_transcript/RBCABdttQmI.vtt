00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Well this is a laurel chain parade.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:12.000
It's a great part of Mont Joliot tradition where we carry this green laurel.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
It definitely feels like an induction ceremony of sorts.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Holding the chain and doing the walk with our sisters and our older sisters and our grandmother classes.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000
It's just very special and I think all of us walking in white just definitely seals the deal for that.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:35.000
I think it's seeing the whole tradition of all the alums standing in line.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:42.000
It gets really exciting and to do it for our year after seeing it for four years just kind of pictures is really moving.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
I know we're not crying yet but I'm really scared I'm going to be sobbing by the end.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:54.000
It's always been something that we hear is really special and we've only ever seen it in pictures because everybody who's an underclassman is gone by now.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:01.000
So to be part of this live and be part of this group already, it hasn't even started but I can feel that there's a really unique energy to it.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Everybody's really excited and feeling connected I guess to the entire community of alums.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:18.000
It's kind of like seeing all of your ancestors march before you and what they've done and that there's proof that there's life past Mont Joliot.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:24.000
It's hope and it's just really nice.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:42.000
1,500 feet is the total length of the chain that they'll carry side by side.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:52.000
We look forward to doing this every year and we plan months in advance to make sure that we have all the roping knowing that this is going to happen every May.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:02:07.000
I've been doing this since I was a kid, my father was doing it since he was a kid, my grandfather, even my great grandfather who started the company in 1912 worked with the college to provide the rope for the last 101 years now.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:17.000
There was nowhere else to come but Mont Joliot College in September 1959 because I was a legacy.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:26.000
My mother was the class of 33, my grandmother the class of 1903.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
It was where I belonged.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
This is the part you cut out.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:41.000
Now what I think about the Laurel Parade is number one, can you walk from the beginning to the end?

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
This year I've had to have a golf cart.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:53.000
The signs, the signs are always creative, they're always appropriate to the era in which we went to college.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
And it's great fun to see the seniors.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
13 is our granddaughter class.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:15.000
About three years ago the 50th reunion class began a tradition of a scarfing ceremony with the seniors and adopting granddaughters.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:35.000
It's part of the tradition, it really doesn't matter whether they're the class of 2013 or 1933 or 53 or 60, wherever in the world you run into a Mont Joliot graduate, there is the same bond.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:46.000
I think it's a good symbol of unity across our generations because women before us have all carried this one chain and we carry it together and we transport it to Mary Lyons grave.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:56.000
So I think it's a good symbol of the traditions of Mont Joliot and the unity of all the women who have gone here before me and before future generations.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:07.000
We weave it over there near Mary Lyons grave and that to me is just like, first of all it's unity and it's like the intermingling of so many different cultures of Mont Joliot that just means a lot here.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:15.000
It feels like the culmination of everything at Mont Joliot, it's finally sinking in that we're going to be graduating.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:25.000
I still don't have it visualized, I think it won't really sink in until I actually pick it up and start to move. I think this whole weekend is a little surreal.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:37.000
I feel like it's going to go by in a blur but at the same time in slow motion as I enjoy the experience and smile and laugh with my friends.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:55.000
When we were seniors we didn't know what was coming. When we walked that gauntlet of older and older alumna, I nearly fainted because I had never thought that we were joining a sisterhood that would go the rest of our lives.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:02.000
And so here we are on the other end of it and it's wonderful looking at those young women and their diversity.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:14.000
So I used to work with Chris Bergbaum in student programs and when I was graduating she came to us and was like, grab the laurel and let it bind you, let it ground you here.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.000
So for me it's my connection with the college, it's my connection with being here.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:26.000
There are a lot of women who have come before us, who paved the way for us and hopefully we're paving the way for the women to come after us.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:35.000
Just seeing I think a hundred years behind us too and knowing that there will be a hundred years in front of us is fantastic. It's so exciting.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:04.000
