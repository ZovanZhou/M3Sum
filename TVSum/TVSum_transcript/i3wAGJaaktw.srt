1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Here at Pet Joy they have the state of the art equipment.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
The cages for instance are stainless steel, they're veterinary cages.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:19,000
They have wooden slats, many cages don't have these so if the dog has an accident he's not sitting in, you know, you can see it goes through.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
And after grooming, we make little bedding for them to make sure they're comfortable.

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
And so they tend to lay down rather than sit up waiting.

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Their tables, a lot of places have tables that don't lower.

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:43,000
So here, if you want to demonstrate Rosie, for instance if a dog is hurt or heavy it's not a good idea, it's not good for the groomer and it's not good for the dog to lift him up.

8
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
You can hurt the dog's hips, shoulders, and it's bad for the groomer.

9
00:00:48,000 --> 00:01:00,000
However, so we have tables here, can you show how, so really fun, really good equipment, state of the art, they advise.

10
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:07,000
So the dog can come on, jump onto the table and then we can elevate the table.

11
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Some bark a lot because of anxiety so we try to minimize any stress, any stress.

12
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:20,000
You know, if they're little, if they're nervous on the table we stop, we just take a moment to comfort the animal, calm him down.

13
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:28,000
So it works, you know, just a little time spent prior to grooming makes the groomer's job much easier.

14
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
So we know them well, we know their habits.

15
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:45,000
We try to sell really good quality food, grain free in particular, and there's, you know, we have some raw as well.

16
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
There's a big movement toward raw now.

17
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
It's what dogs have been eating for thousands of years.

18
00:01:50,000 --> 00:02:01,000
So we have, we look for foods that are, you know, with like not factory farm salmon but rather wild caught, you know, salmon, things like that.

19
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Grain free, gluten free, you know, those are serious issues for dogs.

20
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I mean, a lot of commercial foods have fillers that they can't process, their bodies can't process and they become ill.

21
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:19,000
You know, dogs that should live until 19 are getting sick at 9 and 12.

22
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:26,000
So we like to carry really good quality food treats and we welcome feedback.

23
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:37,000
We welcome a lot of feedback.
