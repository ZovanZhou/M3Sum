00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Hey everybody, what's going on? It's Josh Beach here and this is the first episode of War Man's Meals.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
So let's go ahead and get right into it.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
I was thinking to myself the other day,

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Self?

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Huh? Huh? Huh? What? What do you want? Huh?

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Self?

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Yeah, that's not my name.

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Okay.

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Um, what is your name then?

10
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Ha ha. No. Turd Ferguson.

11
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Okay, Turd Ferguson.

12
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Yeah, what do you want?

13
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:33,000
What should we do? I've got some hot links, I've got some ketchup, I've got some onions. What do you think?

14
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Peppers. Peppers. Gotta have some peppers. Put some peppers. Peppers.

15
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Obviously myself is being stubborn, or Turd Ferguson.

16
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
So, bottom line is this. We're going to be making some spicy sausage sandwiches.

17
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Mmm, yeah. I can't wait.

18
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Green pepper.

19
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Onion.

20
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Simple.

21
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Cheap.

22
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Sixty cents. Sixty cents. Cheap.

23
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
But what do you need in order to cut those onions and peppers?

24
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Sharp stuff.

25
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Hey man. Hey.

26
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Knife sharpening.

27
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Hey, hey, now leave me alone. I'm playing Rad Racer.

28
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Mmm.

29
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Cut it.

30
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
And cut it good.

31
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Peel that onion.

32
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Mmm. Cutting onions. Being a man.

33
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Mmm.

34
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Mmm. Ow. I got goose in my eye.

35
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Hey, what in the world man? What's going on?

36
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Geez, next thing you know you're going to be burning your face off. Give me a break.

37
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Don't eat a whole onion.

38
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Flake it off. Onions are layers.

39
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Layers of onion.

40
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Be good.

41
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
On a spicy sausage sandwich.

42
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Cut them thinner.

43
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Don't want it too thick either.

44
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Nice and thin. Slices.

45
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Not like the big stupid bite that I took.

46
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Small.

47
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Green pepper. Green pepper. Take the label off.

48
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Labels are nasty. Not good for one's health.

49
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I don't know what the white stuff is, but you don't want it.

50
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Pepper strips.

51
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Helps stop you from crying from the onion.

52
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Fresh pepper.

53
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
And it wouldn't be spicy sausage sandwiches without...

54
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Boom. Spicy hot sauce.

55
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,000
The best. How much were these back? One buck. A buck.

56
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Alright. We've spent, how much now? 220?

57
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Not including tax?

58
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
What's the last ingredient?

59
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
All natural. Ketchup in a bottle.

60
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Yeah, that's right. Look at me cover the label with my hand.

61
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Why? Because they're not a sponsor. That's why.

62
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
How much was the bottle? Two bucks.

63
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,000
The whole meal costs less than five bucks. Now that's a poor man's meal. Let's cook it.

64
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,000
If you can't stand the heat, get out of the kitchen.

65
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
We're going to cook this for about 45 minutes.

66
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
What's that going to do to ketchup? Caramelize it.

67
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Oh yeah, ketchup.

68
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
How much ketchup? Enough.

69
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
There you go.

70
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Always remember to shake well.

71
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Add links. Right in.

72
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
That's what I'm talking about.

73
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Peppers and onions, right on top. Boom.

74
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Don't want the ketchup to get in the way.

75
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Finally, cover.

76
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
And what's wrong with my cover? It's too big for my pan.

77
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Why? I don't know.

78
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I don't have pan covers. I'm just poor. Sorry.

79
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Leave it sit for about 45 minutes. Let's see what happens.

80
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Blink of an eye. Blink your eye. Maybe snack time.

81
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I'm going to eat this.

82
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I'm going to eat this.

83
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Blink of an eye. Blink your eye.

84
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Maybe snap a finger. 45 minutes will go by just like this.

85
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,000
The beauty of it is, it cooks for 45 minutes right here on the stove.

86
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
This kind of thing you can stick in a crock pot and cook for 7 hours.

87
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I wouldn't recommend cooking it any longer, but still.

88
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Cook it for as long as you need or think necessary.

89
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
It's good. Low heat. Don't want to over boil it.

90
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
You can see that ketchup caramelizing already.

91
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
It turns into like a natural barbecue sauce with those green peppers and onions.

92
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Good stuff.

93
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Now, bread. Not just any bread.

94
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
But you're going to want to get yourself a stadium style bun or a hoagie.

95
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Why? You need something with a little bit of size to it.

96
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
A little hot dog bun is not going to work.

97
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Now,

98
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
get yourself a lake.

99
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Just like that.

100
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Mmm.

101
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Get yourself a spoon of the sauce and veggies.

102
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Mix it up a little bit here.

103
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
There we go.

104
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
That's what I'm talking about.

105
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Get some on there.

106
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Some more onions. I'm an onion lover myself.

107
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Green pepper.

108
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
And bam.

109
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Just like that.

110
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Spicy sausage sandwiches.

111
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Yum. And freaking hot.

112
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Let it cool down a little bit.

113
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Mmm.

114
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Mmm.

115
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Now that is a tasty poor man's meal.

116
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
One of my favorite things to do.

117
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Thanks, Dad.

118
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
So, I hope you enjoyed it.

119
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Join me next time for another episode of Poor Man's Meals.

120
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:58,000
And until then, keep on eating.
