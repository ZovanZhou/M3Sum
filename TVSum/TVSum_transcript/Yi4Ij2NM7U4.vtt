00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Hey everybody, what's going on? It's Josh Beach here and this is the first episode of War Man's Meals.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
So let's go ahead and get right into it.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
I was thinking to myself the other day,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Self?

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Huh? Huh? Huh? What? What do you want? Huh?

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Self?

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Yeah, that's not my name.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Okay.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Um, what is your name then?

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Ha ha. No. Turd Ferguson.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Okay, Turd Ferguson.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Yeah, what do you want?

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.000
What should we do? I've got some hot links, I've got some ketchup, I've got some onions. What do you think?

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Peppers. Peppers. Gotta have some peppers. Put some peppers. Peppers.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Obviously myself is being stubborn, or Turd Ferguson.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000
So, bottom line is this. We're going to be making some spicy sausage sandwiches.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Mmm, yeah. I can't wait.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Green pepper.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Onion.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Simple.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Cheap.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Sixty cents. Sixty cents. Cheap.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
But what do you need in order to cut those onions and peppers?

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Sharp stuff.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:14.000
Hey man. Hey.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Knife sharpening.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Hey, hey, now leave me alone. I'm playing Rad Racer.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.000
Mmm.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.000
Cut it.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
And cut it good.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
Peel that onion.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
Mmm. Cutting onions. Being a man.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
Mmm.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.000
Mmm. Ow. I got goose in my eye.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
Hey, what in the world man? What's going on?

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.000
Geez, next thing you know you're going to be burning your face off. Give me a break.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
Don't eat a whole onion.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
Flake it off. Onions are layers.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
Layers of onion.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
Be good.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
On a spicy sausage sandwich.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
Cut them thinner.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
Don't want it too thick either.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
Nice and thin. Slices.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
Not like the big stupid bite that I took.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.000
Small.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
Green pepper. Green pepper. Take the label off.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
Labels are nasty. Not good for one's health.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.000
I don't know what the white stuff is, but you don't want it.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
Pepper strips.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
Helps stop you from crying from the onion.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
Fresh pepper.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
And it wouldn't be spicy sausage sandwiches without...

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
Boom. Spicy hot sauce.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.000
The best. How much were these back? One buck. A buck.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
Alright. We've spent, how much now? 220?

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
Not including tax?

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
What's the last ingredient?

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000
All natural. Ketchup in a bottle.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000
Yeah, that's right. Look at me cover the label with my hand.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000
Why? Because they're not a sponsor. That's why.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000
How much was the bottle? Two bucks.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.000
The whole meal costs less than five bucks. Now that's a poor man's meal. Let's cook it.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.000
If you can't stand the heat, get out of the kitchen.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
We're going to cook this for about 45 minutes.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
What's that going to do to ketchup? Caramelize it.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
Oh yeah, ketchup.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000
How much ketchup? Enough.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.000
There you go.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
Always remember to shake well.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
Add links. Right in.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
That's what I'm talking about.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
Peppers and onions, right on top. Boom.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
Don't want the ketchup to get in the way.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.000
Finally, cover.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000
And what's wrong with my cover? It's too big for my pan.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000
Why? I don't know.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.000
I don't have pan covers. I'm just poor. Sorry.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.000
Leave it sit for about 45 minutes. Let's see what happens.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000
Blink of an eye. Blink your eye. Maybe snack time.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000
I'm going to eat this.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000
I'm going to eat this.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
Blink of an eye. Blink your eye.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000
Maybe snap a finger. 45 minutes will go by just like this.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:55.000
The beauty of it is, it cooks for 45 minutes right here on the stove.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000
This kind of thing you can stick in a crock pot and cook for 7 hours.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000
I wouldn't recommend cooking it any longer, but still.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000
Cook it for as long as you need or think necessary.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000
It's good. Low heat. Don't want to over boil it.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000
You can see that ketchup caramelizing already.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000
It turns into like a natural barbecue sauce with those green peppers and onions.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000
Good stuff.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000
Now, bread. Not just any bread.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000
But you're going to want to get yourself a stadium style bun or a hoagie.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000
Why? You need something with a little bit of size to it.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000
A little hot dog bun is not going to work.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000
Now,

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000
get yourself a lake.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.000
Just like that.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.000
Mmm.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.000
Get yourself a spoon of the sauce and veggies.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000
Mix it up a little bit here.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.000
There we go.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.000
That's what I'm talking about.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000
Get some on there.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000
Some more onions. I'm an onion lover myself.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000
Green pepper.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.000
And bam.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000
Just like that.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000
Spicy sausage sandwiches.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000
Yum. And freaking hot.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.000
Let it cool down a little bit.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000
Mmm.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000
Mmm.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.000
Now that is a tasty poor man's meal.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.000
One of my favorite things to do.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.000
Thanks, Dad.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.000
So, I hope you enjoyed it.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000
Join me next time for another episode of Poor Man's Meals.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:58.000
And until then, keep on eating.
