1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:18,800
I get very, very irritated with food that when you bite into it, it burns your mouth.

2
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:24,080
And then you have this thing you want to eat and you've got to blow on it for a few seconds.

3
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:30,040
And fried chicken can be deceiving because on the outside, you might just tap it with

4
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:32,160
your finger and be like, all right, that's ready.

5
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:37,320
But it's trapping heat that could burn your tongue.

6
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:43,640
So I think it's important with a fried chicken sandwich, you lock the temperature, texture,

7
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:49,480
ratio dialed in, where when you hand it to somebody at a festival, they can eat it without

8
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:51,480
fear of burning their tongue.

9
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:57,680
So I'm all about getting that texture on the outside, the moisture on the inside, and the

10
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:00,400
heat balance dialed in.

11
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:05,320
So I think when you get all those elements together, those are the main key factors I

12
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:08,360
look for in a fried chicken sandwich.

13
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:12,760
Hi, my name is James McDuffie.

14
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:16,920
I'm the chef here at Joseph Leonard in the West Village.

15
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:19,240
What makes our fried chicken sandwich different?

16
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:21,320
It's a great question.

17
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:27,480
I think fried chicken is one of those things, like a burger, that it's in its simplicity.

18
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:29,960
You can do it really, really well.

19
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:34,080
Or you can do it haphazardly and it comes out not as amazing.

20
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:37,760
And I think ours is one of the better ones in the city, although there are some other

21
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:40,160
fried chickens out there that I aspire to.

22
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:46,480
The chicken is brined, then marinated in Tabasco and buttermilk, then dredged in seasoned flour.

23
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:47,480
And it's crisp.

24
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:48,480
It's awesome.

25
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:55,360
I would go toe to toe with anybody out there on a fried chicken competition.

26
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:58,440
I want something that's going to bring some acid to my chicken sandwich.

27
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:03,320
I want something that's cold, like we use pickled cucumbers.

28
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:07,320
I want something that's going to be cold, it's going to bring nice acid, it's going

29
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:13,080
to balance the temperatures as well as the richness.

30
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:21,040
And really, I think the right use of acid helps food enhance and explode in your mouth.

31
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,800
I think the toppings make it unique.

32
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:28,640
I think just the way the chicken itself plays with the honey and the sweetness and that,

33
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:34,600
the spiciness and the Tabasco, the crunch of the cucumber and the radish in it.

34
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,280
I think it's a unique sandwich.

35
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:38,520
I think it's delicious.

36
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:41,480
It's one of those things, we've tried taking it off the menu.

37
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:47,920
And we've had a lot of pushback from guests who come on a regular basis for it.

38
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:58,120
And so we keep it around.

39
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:05,880
My philosophy on food, I think ultimately, no matter what, it boils down to one common

40
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:11,880
principle which is the intention is to create a product that we're proud of that makes the

41
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:14,240
person eating it smile.

42
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:16,840
This is a damn good sandwich.

43
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:23,340
So you know, we wanted to do what we call an American bistro here.

44
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:27,120
Because we're in America, I'm American, part of my family's American.

45
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:33,840
And then within that, offer a few inflictions of French food that we love.

46
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:39,200
We are trying really, really hard to make connections with our guests.

47
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:47,480
We are trying really, really hard to establish real, sincere, genuine, deep connections with

48
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:49,440
the people that walk in our door.

49
00:03:49,440 --> 00:04:15,200
And then if you're doing it well, then maybe that's unique.
