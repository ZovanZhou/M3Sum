It's the granddaddy of bike tricks. Either you can do it or you can't. Today

2
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:10,080
we're gonna teach you how to wheelie.

3
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:31,480
Hey guys, doing a wheelie is something we've all desired to do since our very

4
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:35,600
first bike ride. It's all about balance. Once you get it, you can ride the wheelie

5
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,680
for miles. My buddy Cole is gonna show us how it's done. Go ahead and do it man.

6
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:44,800
First, get comfortable pulling your front wheel up. Then push with your lead

7
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:49,240
foot and lean back. Practice this riding around an empty parking lot, but don't

8
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:52,520
use your straps just in case you have to bail. Now once you're able to get the

9
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:56,520
front wheel up, you need to find a balance point. So try maybe going to a

10
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:00,120
wall and holding on and finding that balance point until you get comfortable.

11
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:04,840
Let's put it all together. Ride forward and pull the front wheel up. Once you

12
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:08,880
push off your lead foot, lean back and find your balance point. Once you are

13
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:12,680
locked in, remember it's a combination of shifting your body weight and the speed

14
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:25,280
that you are pedaling. Thank You George. I'll have to practice that as soon as

15
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:29,640
I'm done here. As always, hit us up on our Twitter if you want to talk or drop a
