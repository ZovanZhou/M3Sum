00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.320
More than two thirds of cars now come with a tyre repair kit instead of a spare wheel.

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:13.320
And while these kits aren't always popular with drivers, if your car has one, you'll

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:21.580
need to know how to use it.

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:27.140
If you get a puncture, pull over and stop as soon as you find a safe place, preferably

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:29.140
away from traffic.

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:36.280
Apply the handbrake and switch your engine off and turn on your hazard lights if necessary.

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:38.680
Now take a look at the puncture.

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:42.920
Sealant kits will only fill holes up to about four millimetres across.

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:45.840
So if you've got a nail in your tyre, that's fine.

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.640
But if the tyre's torn or the alloy wheel itself is damaged, you're going to need to

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.240
call a breakdown service.

00:00:55.240 --> 00:01:00.080
You'll find your repair kit in the boot, it'll either be in the side panels or as here under

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:01.080
the boot floor.

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:07.640
Now it consists of two parts, the bottle of sealant and the compressor for pumping up

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:09.740
the tyres.

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:13.980
If you do have an object like a nail in your tyre, don't try to remove it.

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:17.800
Just unscrew the valve cap and attach the sealant bottle.

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:23.520
And once attached, the pressurised sealant will spread around inside the tyre.

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:28.320
On this Toyota, the air compressor for inflating the tyres is then attached to the back of

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:29.320
the bottle.

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:33.840
However, on many other cars, you'll need to unscrew the bottle and attach the air compressor

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.160
directly to the valve on the tyre.

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:39.600
Now it's time to inflate your tyre.

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.680
So take the lead from the compressor and plug it into the cigarette lighter or 12-volt socket

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:46.460
inside your car.

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:48.880
Then start the engine.

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:53.720
Now turn the compressor on and inflate the tyre until it reaches the recommended pressure

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:57.360
shown in your car's handbook.

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:02.320
If the tyre isn't inflating properly, try rolling the car forward a few metres to help

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:04.680
the sealant spread around.

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:17.880
If that doesn't work, you may still need to call a breakdown service.

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:20.200
If you manage to repair the tyre, well done.

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:25.000
You can carry on driving, but you'll need to stop a couple of miles down the road to

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.640
check your tyre pressures again.

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:30.880
And remember, this is only a temporary fix.

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:36.040
So drive gently and keep your speed below 50 miles an hour.

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:40.040
When you get to a garage, remember that you'll need to buy a new can of sealant and a new

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:46.680
tyre, which tests every aspect of tyre performance, from wet braking to wear.

00:02:46.680 --> 00:03:00.400
So check our reviews before you buy.
