1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,400
One dog getting a new leash on life.

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:04,960
At his heaviest, Obie, a five-year-old Dachshund,

3
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:07,840
weighed a whopping 77 pounds.

4
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:09,200
That's twice the normal size,

5
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:11,400
but thanks to Obie's new owner, or foster parent,

6
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:13,400
he's going on a strict diet.

7
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:15,560
Nora Venata is Obie's adopted mom.

8
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:17,200
She's here along with Dr. Andrew Kaplan,

9
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:20,160
City Veterinary Care, and founder of the Tobie Project.

10
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:22,120
Good day to all of you guys.

11
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:22,960
Thank you.

12
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:24,520
So when you heard about Tobie,

13
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:28,280
with Obie, and you just, Tobie, Obie,

14
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:31,720
when you heard about Obie, and he actually showed up,

15
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:34,480
had you ever, did it match what you were expecting?

16
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:35,320
No.

17
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:36,160
I mean, he was bigger than you.

18
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:37,400
I had no idea.

19
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:39,320
When you heard about a 77-pound Dachshund.

20
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:40,160
Right.

21
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:42,200
They estimated he was 70,

22
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:44,820
and I thought, I hadn't seen a picture,

23
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:46,920
and I thought, well, he maybe we're expecting

24
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:49,400
a Basset Hound here, and there's no way

25
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:51,640
he could possibly weigh 70 pounds.

26
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:55,480
And I saw him, and he really is a purebred Dachshund.

27
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:57,880
And I took him to the vet the next day,

28
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:59,760
and he weighed in at 77.

29
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,920
So Dr. Kaplan, I assume this is the biggest Dachshund

30
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:03,760
you've ever seen.

31
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:06,200
No doubt, this is the biggest Dachshund I've ever seen.

32
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:08,280
I mean, is this, is he healthy?

33
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:12,440
I mean, what are the dangers of a dog weighing this much?

34
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:15,440
You would think, if you're thinking about people,

35
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:17,620
that being overweight could lead to things

36
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:20,720
like atherosclerosis, and heart attacks, and hypertension,

37
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,280
but dogs aren't at risk for these things,

38
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:23,120
for being overweight.

39
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:25,360
For dogs, it's orthopedic mostly.

40
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:29,200
So a Dachshund is, as most people know,

41
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:34,160
are predisposed to slipped discs, and orthopedic problems.

42
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:35,920
And so that's really what most of his risk is.

43
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:36,760
This could just exacerbate that.

44
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:38,080
Yeah, I mean, this kind of weight

45
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:40,320
is gonna wreak havoc on his joints.

46
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:44,000
So Nora, what are you doing to get Obi more fit?

47
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,400
What kind of diet is he on?

48
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:47,860
We are just putting him on a high-protein,

49
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:50,760
high-fiber, low-energy diet.

50
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:52,920
And he's able to eat, we estimate,

51
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:55,240
we're feeding him about two cups a day.

52
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:57,440
And what kind of exercise?

53
00:01:57,440 --> 00:02:00,480
His only exercise right now is going from house

54
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:02,800
to outside to go potty, and to house.

55
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,740
He moves around on his own.

56
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:06,400
And that's his only exercise for now.

57
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,920
And he's moving better every day.

58
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:08,960
Is that a good plan, doc?

59
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,240
Oh yeah.

60
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:13,400
High-protein diets and low-fat diets in dogs

61
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,300
work just like they do in people.

62
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:17,200
And the fiber helps burn calories,

63
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,960
and it helps reduce appetite as well.

64
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:21,240
Now, according to the Association for Pet Obesity

65
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:23,800
and Prevention, 53% of adult dogs,

66
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:28,000
55% of adult cats are overweight.

67
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,240
Is this an epidemic we're seeing,

68
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,960
not only in the human population,

69
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,680
but in our pet population as well?

70
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:33,640
Absolutely.

71
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:34,480
Absolutely.

72
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,160
People have good intentions, and they feed their dogs,

73
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,240
I think, what they think they're supposed to feed them.

74
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,600
But it's the treats.

75
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:40,440
Yeah.

76
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:41,640
I find it's the treats, and it's the binge,

77
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:43,200
just like people, it's the binge eating.

78
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,200
It's eating between meals.

79
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:47,040
Is there a correlation between overweight pet owners

80
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,400
and overweight pets?

81
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,440
I don't know if there's been a study done to look at that,

82
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:52,320
but in my clinical practice, yes.

83
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:53,800
I see a lot of dogs who are overweight,

84
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,840
and their owners tend to be overweight as well.

85
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,280
So Nora, how long do you think it's gonna take Obi

86
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:00,080
to get back to his fighting weight?

87
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,040
It could take about a year.

88
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:04,240
Our goal is 1% weight loss a week.

89
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:07,240
So far, he's lost about two pounds a week, which is perfect.

90
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,400
Good, all right.

91
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,960
So once he loses the weight,

92
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,720
he'll have a healthy, normal life?

93
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:13,520
Yeah, he should, absolutely.

94
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:15,000
He's very happy.

95
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,280
Are you happy, Toby, Obi?

96
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,480
He's very happy, he grins.

97
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:22,480
All right, okay, bud.
