00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.400
One dog getting a new leash on life.

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:04.960
At his heaviest, Obie, a five-year-old Dachshund,

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:07.840
weighed a whopping 77 pounds.

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:09.200
That's twice the normal size,

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:11.400
but thanks to Obie's new owner, or foster parent,

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.400
he's going on a strict diet.

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:15.560
Nora Venata is Obie's adopted mom.

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:17.200
She's here along with Dr. Andrew Kaplan,

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:20.160
City Veterinary Care, and founder of the Tobie Project.

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.120
Good day to all of you guys.

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:22.960
Thank you.

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:24.520
So when you heard about Tobie,

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:28.280
with Obie, and you just, Tobie, Obie,

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:31.720
when you heard about Obie, and he actually showed up,

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:34.480
had you ever, did it match what you were expecting?

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:35.320
No.

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:36.160
I mean, he was bigger than you.

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:37.400
I had no idea.

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.320
When you heard about a 77-pound Dachshund.

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:40.160
Right.

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:42.200
They estimated he was 70,

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.820
and I thought, I hadn't seen a picture,

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.920
and I thought, well, he maybe we're expecting

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.400
a Basset Hound here, and there's no way

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:51.640
he could possibly weigh 70 pounds.

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:55.480
And I saw him, and he really is a purebred Dachshund.

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:57.880
And I took him to the vet the next day,

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:59.760
and he weighed in at 77.

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.920
So Dr. Kaplan, I assume this is the biggest Dachshund

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:03.760
you've ever seen.

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:06.200
No doubt, this is the biggest Dachshund I've ever seen.

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.280
I mean, is this, is he healthy?

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.440
I mean, what are the dangers of a dog weighing this much?

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:15.440
You would think, if you're thinking about people,

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:17.620
that being overweight could lead to things

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:20.720
like atherosclerosis, and heart attacks, and hypertension,

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:22.280
but dogs aren't at risk for these things,

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:23.120
for being overweight.

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:25.360
For dogs, it's orthopedic mostly.

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:29.200
So a Dachshund is, as most people know,

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:34.160
are predisposed to slipped discs, and orthopedic problems.

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:35.920
And so that's really what most of his risk is.

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:36.760
This could just exacerbate that.

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:38.080
Yeah, I mean, this kind of weight

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:40.320
is gonna wreak havoc on his joints.

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.000
So Nora, what are you doing to get Obi more fit?

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.400
What kind of diet is he on?

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:47.860
We are just putting him on a high-protein,

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:50.760
high-fiber, low-energy diet.

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:52.920
And he's able to eat, we estimate,

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.240
we're feeding him about two cups a day.

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:57.440
And what kind of exercise?

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:00.480
His only exercise right now is going from house

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:02.800
to outside to go potty, and to house.

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:04.740
He moves around on his own.

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.400
And that's his only exercise for now.

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:07.920
And he's moving better every day.

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:08.960
Is that a good plan, doc?

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:10.240
Oh yeah.

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:13.400
High-protein diets and low-fat diets in dogs

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.300
work just like they do in people.

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.200
And the fiber helps burn calories,

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:18.960
and it helps reduce appetite as well.

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:21.240
Now, according to the Association for Pet Obesity

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:23.800
and Prevention, 53% of adult dogs,

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:28.000
55% of adult cats are overweight.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.240
Is this an epidemic we're seeing,

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:30.960
not only in the human population,

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:32.680
but in our pet population as well?

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:33.640
Absolutely.

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:34.480
Absolutely.

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:36.160
People have good intentions, and they feed their dogs,

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.240
I think, what they think they're supposed to feed them.

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:39.600
But it's the treats.

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:40.440
Yeah.

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:41.640
I find it's the treats, and it's the binge,

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:43.200
just like people, it's the binge eating.

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:44.200
It's eating between meals.

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:47.040
Is there a correlation between overweight pet owners

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:48.400
and overweight pets?

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.440
I don't know if there's been a study done to look at that,

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:52.320
but in my clinical practice, yes.

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:53.800
I see a lot of dogs who are overweight,

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:55.840
and their owners tend to be overweight as well.

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:58.280
So Nora, how long do you think it's gonna take Obi

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:00.080
to get back to his fighting weight?

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:02.040
It could take about a year.

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.240
Our goal is 1% weight loss a week.

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:07.240
So far, he's lost about two pounds a week, which is perfect.

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:08.400
Good, all right.

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:09.960
So once he loses the weight,

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:11.720
he'll have a healthy, normal life?

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:13.520
Yeah, he should, absolutely.

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:15.000
He's very happy.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.280
Are you happy, Toby, Obi?

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:17.480
He's very happy, he grins.

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:22.480
All right, okay, bud.
