1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,180
So this is a table, it's nice isn't it? Table and chairs. Very nice you might say

2
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:15,240
you know but there's a story behind it come with me. This table just got

3
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:21,960
delivered but and this is where the story begins. A truck had to obviously

4
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:29,740
deliver something as large as that and the truck got stuck there in the

5
00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:36,400
distance is the truck. As you can see the truck ran off the road nearly tipped

6
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:43,000
over went down the gully. So here's the gully that could have gone down as you

7
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,080
can see we've tied it secured it with a piece of dental floss which will surely

8
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:53,680
hold should the truck trip over. There's also this tree which is sort of holding

9
00:00:53,680 --> 00:01:00,600
it on. Let's look down the side shall we? There we go there's the truck. That's my

10
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:06,400
brother Paul laughing in the background. Here's the dental floss that's holding

11
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:15,480
the truck up sort of. Whales off the ground on one side and this is all

12
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:23,920
because my brother wanted a table. Put so many people out look at that almost

13
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:33,200
ready to fall down the ravine. So this is only half the drama because there's a

14
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:38,680
truck coming that's gonna try to pull us out. That'll be a lot of fun and we'll be

15
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:43,840
there ladies and gentlemen we'll be there. There's great forces are brought

16
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:52,520
to bear on this stuck truck that Mark made. There you go look milliseconds away

17
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:59,920
from doom. It stopped the driver who's a large husky Maori guy let out a girlish

18
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:06,000
squeal and as you can see the doors still open from where he leapt pirouetted

19
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:15,480
and landed on the ground. As the sun sets on another day in paradise we look at a

20
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:22,000
debacle that only Mark Young could be responsible for. Now we've got another

21
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:31,920
big truck to pull the truck that Mark got stuck in the rut because of a table.

22
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:37,680
Mark's stuck truck the bat truck

23
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:48,720
closer and closer they get

24
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,800
there's a lesson for us all

25
00:02:54,800 --> 00:03:03,440
as you can see they're going to employ the pal finger an ominous sounding

26
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:11,920
named piece of machinery. This is the man responsible

27
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:19,520
without whom the situation would never have happened

28
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:27,120
Mark's stuck truck

29
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:35,280
as you can see Mark is basically marinating in stress over this

30
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:48,800
holds himself directly responsible for this calamity

31
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:10,800
so

32
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:20,800
so

33
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:40,000
there you go

34
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:54,480
and there's a solution here it is the deep ruts of despair caused by this

35
00:04:54,480 --> 00:05:04,960
stuck truck of mine. As Mark leaves the scene of the crime the two trucks

36
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:16,440
rescue truck finger pal and Mark's stuck truck peel off and with a laugh falling

37
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:37,440
branch leave the property there you go what an adventure
