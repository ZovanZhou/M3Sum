00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:18.800
I get very, very irritated with food that when you bite into it, it burns your mouth.

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:24.080
And then you have this thing you want to eat and you've got to blow on it for a few seconds.

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:30.040
And fried chicken can be deceiving because on the outside, you might just tap it with

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:32.160
your finger and be like, all right, that's ready.

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.320
But it's trapping heat that could burn your tongue.

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:43.640
So I think it's important with a fried chicken sandwich, you lock the temperature, texture,

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:49.480
ratio dialed in, where when you hand it to somebody at a festival, they can eat it without

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:51.480
fear of burning their tongue.

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:57.680
So I'm all about getting that texture on the outside, the moisture on the inside, and the

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:00.400
heat balance dialed in.

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:05.320
So I think when you get all those elements together, those are the main key factors I

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:08.360
look for in a fried chicken sandwich.

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:12.760
Hi, my name is James McDuffie.

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:16.920
I'm the chef here at Joseph Leonard in the West Village.

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.240
What makes our fried chicken sandwich different?

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:21.320
It's a great question.

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:27.480
I think fried chicken is one of those things, like a burger, that it's in its simplicity.

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:29.960
You can do it really, really well.

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:34.080
Or you can do it haphazardly and it comes out not as amazing.

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:37.760
And I think ours is one of the better ones in the city, although there are some other

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:40.160
fried chickens out there that I aspire to.

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:46.480
The chicken is brined, then marinated in Tabasco and buttermilk, then dredged in seasoned flour.

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:47.480
And it's crisp.

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:48.480
It's awesome.

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:55.360
I would go toe to toe with anybody out there on a fried chicken competition.

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:58.440
I want something that's going to bring some acid to my chicken sandwich.

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:03.320
I want something that's cold, like we use pickled cucumbers.

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:07.320
I want something that's going to be cold, it's going to bring nice acid, it's going

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:13.080
to balance the temperatures as well as the richness.

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:21.040
And really, I think the right use of acid helps food enhance and explode in your mouth.

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:22.800
I think the toppings make it unique.

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:28.640
I think just the way the chicken itself plays with the honey and the sweetness and that,

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:34.600
the spiciness and the Tabasco, the crunch of the cucumber and the radish in it.

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:36.280
I think it's a unique sandwich.

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.520
I think it's delicious.

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:41.480
It's one of those things, we've tried taking it off the menu.

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:47.920
And we've had a lot of pushback from guests who come on a regular basis for it.

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:58.120
And so we keep it around.

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:05.880
My philosophy on food, I think ultimately, no matter what, it boils down to one common

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:11.880
principle which is the intention is to create a product that we're proud of that makes the

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:14.240
person eating it smile.

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:16.840
This is a damn good sandwich.

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:23.340
So you know, we wanted to do what we call an American bistro here.

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:27.120
Because we're in America, I'm American, part of my family's American.

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:33.840
And then within that, offer a few inflictions of French food that we love.

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:39.200
We are trying really, really hard to make connections with our guests.

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:47.480
We are trying really, really hard to establish real, sincere, genuine, deep connections with

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:49.440
the people that walk in our door.

00:03:49.440 --> 00:04:15.200
And then if you're doing it well, then maybe that's unique.
