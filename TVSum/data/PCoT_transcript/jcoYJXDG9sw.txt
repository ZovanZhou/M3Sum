Frame56-57: about 600 calories a day.
Frame57-58: And we're also giving him some supplements
Frame58-59: to help with his metabolism and his joints.
Frame59-60: And then, as far as exercise goes,
Frame60-61: he's not doing much right now.
Frame61-62: He's just going from the house to outside to go potty and back.
Frame62-63: But eventually, we hope to get him swimming,
Frame63-64: and maybe even walking on an underwater treadmill.
Frame64-65: So Dr. Kaplan, how important is diet
Frame65-66: when it comes to weight loss in dogs?
Frame66-68: It's very important.
Frame68-69: High-protein diets and low-fat diets work just like they do in people.
Frame69-70: And fiber helps burn calories and reduce appetite.
Frame70-71: So it's really important to have a good diet plan
Frame71-72: when you're trying to help your pet lose weight.
Frame72-73: And Nora, what's Obie's goal weight,
Frame73-74: and how long do you think it will take for him to get there?
Frame74-75: His goal weight is around 30 pounds,
Frame75-76: so he needs to lose about half of his body weight.
Frame76-77: Our goal is for him to lose about 1% of his weight per week,
Frame77-78: and he's been losing about two pounds a week so far.
Frame78-79: So we're hoping that within a year or so,
Frame79-80: he'll be at a healthy, normal weight.
Frame80-81: That's great. Well, thank you both so much for being here,
Frame81-82: and we wish Obie all the best on his weight loss journey.
