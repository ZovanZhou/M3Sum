1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,280
The reason I'm at this cockeyed angle is that we are at the spot on the Needles Highway,

2
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:18,000
just maybe a mile in, where it goes to a one lane stone tunnel.

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,880
And a charter bus is trying to get through here.

4
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:23,840
And I just had to get video of this.

5
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:48,640
Because I can't imagine this thing is going to make it through here.

6
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:55,160
And even if he gets through, this route is so windy that, and I was commenting on the

7
00:00:55,160 --> 00:01:00,240
way up here, that I can't imagine a charter bus coming through here because it's too long

8
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:03,320
to go around these hairpin turns.

9
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:06,320
Or near hairpin.

10
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:27,120
But he's obviously making it, but I wouldn't want to try it.

11
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:53,720
So he's waving at some people, apparently they're...

12
00:01:53,720 --> 00:02:20,720
Boy, that's an up close and personal look at the...

13
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:36,240
And the people are cheering because he made it through there.

14
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:39,760
I can't believe he made it.

15
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:43,280
And if someone would have told me, I would have told them they were full of it.
